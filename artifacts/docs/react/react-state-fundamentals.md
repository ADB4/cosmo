# State A Components Memory

Components often need to change what's on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking "next" on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking "buy" should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to "remember" things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called *state*.

* What pair of values the `useState` Hook returns

* Why state is called local

## When a regular variable isn’t enough {/*when-a-regular-variable-isnt-enough*/}

Here's a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the "Next" button should show the next sculpture by changing the `index` to `1`, then `2`, and so on. However, this **won't work** (you can try it!):

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


The `handleClick` event handler is updating a local variable, `index`. But two things prevent that change from being visible:

1. **Local variables don't persist between renders.** When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn't consider any changes to the local variables.
2. **Changes to local variables won't trigger renders.** React doesn't realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:

1. **Retain** the data between renders.
2. **Trigger** React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

The [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) Hook provides those two things:

1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
2. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

## Adding a state variable {/*adding-a-state-variable*/}

To add a state variable, import `useState` from React at the top of the file:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

Then, replace this line:

```js
let index = 0;
```

with

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

`index` is a state variable and `setIndex` is the setter function.

> The `[` and `]` syntax here is called [array destructuring](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment) and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by `useState` always has exactly two items.

This is how they work together in `handleClick`:

```js
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

Now clicking the "Next" button switches the current sculpture:

### Meet your first Hook {/*meet-your-first-hook*/}

In React, `useState`, as well as any other function starting with "`use`", is called a Hook.

*Hooks* are special functions that are only available while React is [rendering](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) (which we'll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you "hook into" different React features.

State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.

> **Pitfall:**
>
> 
> 
> **Hooks—functions starting with `use`—can only be called at the top level of your components or [your own Hooks.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)** You can't call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it's helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component's needs. You "use" React features at the top of your component similar to how you "import" modules at the top of your file.

### Anatomy of `useState` {/*anatomy-of-usestate*/}

When you call [`useState`](/reference/react/useState), you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

In this case, you want React to remember `index`.

> **Note:**
>
> 
> 
> The convention is to name this pair like `const [something, setSomething]`. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.
> 
> 


The only argument to `useState` is the **initial value** of your state variable. In this example, the `index`'s initial value is set to `0` with `useState(0)`. 

Every time your component renders, `useState` gives you an array containing two values:

1. The **state variable** (`index`) with the value you stored.
2. The **state setter function** (`setIndex`) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

Here's how that happens in action:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **Your component renders the first time.** Because you passed `0` to `useState` as the initial value for `index`, it will return `[0, setIndex]`. React remembers `0` is the latest state value.
2. **You update the state.** When a user clicks the button, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`. `index` is `0`, so it's `setIndex(1)`. This tells React to remember `index` is `1` now and triggers another render.
3. **Your component's second render.** React still sees `useState(0)`, but because React *remembers* that you set `index` to `1`, it returns `[1, setIndex]` instead.
4. And so on!

## Giving a component multiple state variables {/*giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables*/}

You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number `index` and a boolean `showMore` that's toggled when you click "Show details":

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like `index` and `showMore` in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it's more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read [Choosing the State Structure](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) for more tips.

> You might have noticed that the `useState` call does not receive any information about *which* state variable it refers to. There is no "identifier" that is passed to `useState`, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.
> 
> Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks **rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.** This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above ("only call Hooks at the top level"), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a [linter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) catches most mistakes.

> Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to `0` before rendering. Each time you call `useState`, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index.

## State is isolated and private {/*state-is-isolated-and-private*/}

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, **if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

In this example, the `Gallery` component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it's "local" to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two `<Gallery />` components, so their state is stored separately.

Also notice how the `Page` component doesn't "know" anything about the `Gallery` state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it.** The parent component can't change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to *remove* state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in [Sharing State Between Components.](/learn/sharing-state-between-components)

* Use a state variable when a component needs to "remember" some information between renders.
* State variables are declared by calling the `useState` Hook.
* Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you "hook into" React features like state.
* Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
* The `useState` Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
* You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
* State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.






# State As A Snapshot

State variables might look like regular JavaScript variables that you can read and write to. However, state behaves more like a snapshot. Setting it does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render.

* How setting state triggers re-renders
* When and how state updates
* Why state does not update immediately after you set it
* How event handlers access a "snapshot" of the state

## Setting state triggers renders {/*setting-state-triggers-renders*/}

You might think of your user interface as changing directly in response to the user event like a click. In React, it works a little differently from this mental model. On the previous page, you saw that [setting state requests a re-render](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) from React. This means that for an interface to react to the event, you need to *update the state*.

In this example, when you press "send", `setIsSent(true)` tells React to re-render the UI:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Here's what happens when you click the button:

1. The `onSubmit` event handler executes.
2. `setIsSent(true)` sets `isSent` to `true` and queues a new render.
3. React re-renders the component according to the new `isSent` value.

Let's take a closer look at the relationship between state and rendering.

## Rendering takes a snapshot in time {/*rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time*/}

["Rendering"](/learn/render-and-commit#step-2-react-renders-your-components) means that React is calling your component, which is a function. The JSX you return from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time. Its props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated **using its state at the time of the render.**

Unlike a photograph or a movie frame, the UI "snapshot" you return is interactive. It includes logic like event handlers that specify what happens in response to inputs. React updates the screen to match this snapshot and connects the event handlers. As a result, pressing a button will trigger the click handler from your JSX.

When React re-renders a component:

1. React calls your function again.
2. Your function returns a new JSX snapshot.
3. React then updates the screen to match the snapshot your function returned.

<IllustrationBlock sequential>
    <Illustration caption="React executing the function" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render1.png" />
    <Illustration caption="Calculating the snapshot" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render2.png" />
    <Illustration caption="Updating the DOM tree" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render3.png" />
</IllustrationBlock>

As a component's memory, state is not like a regular variable that disappears after your function returns. State actually "lives" in React itself--as if on a shelf!--outside of your function. When React calls your component, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render. Your component returns a snapshot of the UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, all calculated **using the state values from that render!**

<IllustrationBlock sequential>
  <Illustration caption="You tell React to update the state" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_state-snapshot1.png" />
  <Illustration caption="React updates the state value" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_state-snapshot2.png" />
  <Illustration caption="React passes a snapshot of the state value into the component" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_state-snapshot3.png" />
</IllustrationBlock>

Here's a little experiment to show you how this works. In this example, you might expect that clicking the "+3" button would increment the counter three times because it calls `setNumber(number + 1)` three times.

See what happens when you click the "+3" button:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Notice that `number` only increments once per click!

**Setting state only changes it for the *next* render.** During the first render, `number` was `0`. This is why, in *that render's* `onClick` handler, the value of `number` is still `0` even after `setNumber(number + 1)` was called:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

Here is what this button's click handler tells React to do:

1. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
    - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.
2. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
    - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.
3. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
    - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.

Even though you called `setNumber(number + 1)` three times, in *this render's* event handler `number` is always `0`, so you set the state to `1` three times. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with `number` equal to `1` rather than `3`.

You can also visualize this by mentally substituting state variables with their values in your code. Since the `number` state variable is `0` for *this render*, its event handler looks like this:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

For the next render, `number` is `1`, so *that render's* click handler looks like this:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

This is why clicking the button again will set the counter to `2`, then to `3` on the next click, and so on.

## State over time {/*state-over-time*/}

Well, that was fun. Try to guess what clicking this button will alert:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


If you use the substitution method from before, you can guess that the alert shows "0":

```js
setNumber(0 + 5);
alert(0);
```

But what if you put a timer on the alert, so it only fires _after_ the component re-rendered? Would it say "0" or "5"? Have a guess!

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Surprised? If you use the substitution method, you can see the "snapshot" of the state passed to the alert.

```js
setNumber(0 + 5);
setTimeout(() => {
  alert(0);
}, 3000);
```

The state stored in React may have changed by the time the alert runs, but it was scheduled using a snapshot of the state at the time the user interacted with it!

**A state variable's value never changes within a render,** even if its event handler's code is asynchronous. Inside *that render's* `onClick`, the value of `number` continues to be `0` even after `setNumber(number + 5)` was called. Its value was "fixed" when React "took the snapshot" of the UI by calling your component.

Here is an example of how that makes your event handlers less prone to timing mistakes. Below is a form that sends a message with a five-second delay. Imagine this scenario:

1. You press the "Send" button, sending "Hello" to Alice.
2. Before the five-second delay ends, you change the value of the "To" field to "Bob".

What do you expect the `alert` to display? Would it display, "You said Hello to Alice"? Or would it display, "You said Hello to Bob"? Make a guess based on what you know, and then try it:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


**React keeps the state values "fixed" within one render's event handlers.** You don't need to worry whether the state has changed while the code is running.

But what if you wanted to read the latest state before a re-render? You'll want to use a [state updater function](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates), covered on the next page!

* Setting state requests a new render.
* React stores state outside of your component, as if on a shelf.
* When you call `useState`, React gives you a snapshot of the state *for that render*.
* Variables and event handlers don't "survive" re-renders. Every render has its own event handlers.
* Every render (and functions inside it) will always "see" the snapshot of the state that React gave to *that* render.
* You can mentally substitute state in event handlers, similarly to how you think about the rendered JSX.
* Event handlers created in the past have the state values from the render in which they were created.






# Queueing A Series Of State Updates

Setting a state variable will queue another render. But sometimes you might want to perform multiple operations on the value before queueing the next render. To do this, it helps to understand how React batches state updates.

* What "batching" is and how React uses it to process multiple state updates
* How to apply several updates to the same state variable in a row

## React batches state updates {/*react-batches-state-updates*/}

You might expect that clicking the "+3" button will increment the counter three times because it calls `setNumber(number + 1)` three times:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


However, as you might recall from the previous section, [each render's state values are fixed](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time), so the value of `number` inside the first render's event handler is always `0`, no matter how many times you call `setNumber(1)`:

```js
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);
```

But there is one other factor at play here. **React waits until *all* code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.** This is why the re-render only happens *after* all these `setNumber()` calls.

This might remind you of a waiter taking an order at the restaurant. A waiter doesn't run to the kitchen at the mention of your first dish! Instead, they let you finish your order, let you make changes to it, and even take orders from other people at the table.

<Illustration src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_react-batching.png"  alt="An elegant cursor at a restaurant places and order multiple times with React, playing the part of the waiter. After she calls setState() multiple times, the waiter writes down the last one she requested as her final order." />

This lets you update multiple state variables--even from multiple components--without triggering too many [re-renders.](/learn/render-and-commit#re-renders-when-state-updates) But this also means that the UI won't be updated until _after_ your event handler, and any code in it, completes. This behavior, also known as **batching,** makes your React app run much faster. It also avoids dealing with confusing "half-finished" renders where only some of the variables have been updated.

**React does not batch across *multiple* intentional events like clicks**--each click is handled separately. Rest assured that React only does batching when it's generally safe to do. This ensures that, for example, if the first button click disables a form, the second click would not submit it again.

## Updating the same state multiple times before the next render {/*updating-the-same-state-multiple-times-before-the-next-render*/}

It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the *next state value* like `setNumber(number + 1)`, you can pass a *function* that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like `setNumber(n => n + 1)`. It is a way to tell React to "do something with the state value" instead of just replacing it.

Try incrementing the counter now:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Here, `n => n + 1` is called an **updater function.** When you pass it to a state setter:

1. React queues this function to be processed after all the other code in the event handler has run.
2. During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state.

```js
setNumber(n => n + 1);
setNumber(n => n + 1);
setNumber(n => n + 1);
```

Here's how React works through these lines of code while executing the event handler:

1. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
1. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
1. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.

When you call `useState` during the next render, React goes through the queue. The previous `number` state was `0`, so that's what React passes to the first updater function as the `n` argument. Then React takes the return value of your previous updater function and passes it to the next updater as `n`, and so on:

|  queued update | `n` | returns |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| `n => n + 1` | `0` | `0 + 1 = 1` |
| `n => n + 1` | `1` | `1 + 1 = 2` |
| `n => n + 1` | `2` | `2 + 1 = 3` |

React stores `3` as the final result and returns it from `useState`.

This is why clicking "+3" in the above example correctly increments the value by 3.
### What happens if you update state after replacing it {/*what-happens-if-you-update-state-after-replacing-it*/}

What about this event handler? What do you think `number` will be in the next render?

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 5);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
}}>
```

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Here's what this event handler tells React to do:

1. `setNumber(number + 5)`: `number` is `0`, so `setNumber(0 + 5)`. React adds *"replace with `5`"* to its queue.
2. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is an updater function. React adds *that function* to its queue.

During the next render, React goes through the state queue:

|   queued update       | `n` | returns |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "replace with `5`" | `0` (unused) | `5` |
| `n => n + 1` | `5` | `5 + 1 = 6` |

React stores `6` as the final result and returns it from `useState`. 

> **Note:**
>
> 
> 
> You may have noticed that `setState(5)` actually works like `setState(n => 5)`, but `n` is unused!
> 
> 


### What happens if you replace state after updating it {/*what-happens-if-you-replace-state-after-updating-it*/}

Let's try one more example. What do you think `number` will be in the next render?

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 5);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
  setNumber(42);
}}>
```

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Here's how React works through these lines of code while executing this event handler:

1. `setNumber(number + 5)`: `number` is `0`, so `setNumber(0 + 5)`. React adds *"replace with `5`"* to its queue.
2. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is an updater function. React adds *that function* to its queue.
3. `setNumber(42)`: React adds *"replace with `42`"* to its queue.

During the next render, React goes through the state queue:

|   queued update       | `n` | returns |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "replace with `5`" | `0` (unused) | `5` |
| `n => n + 1` | `5` | `5 + 1 = 6` |
| "replace with `42`" | `6` (unused) | `42` |

Then React stores `42` as the final result and returns it from `useState`.

To summarize, here's how you can think of what you're passing to the `setNumber` state setter:

* **An updater function** (e.g. `n => n + 1`) gets added to the queue.
* **Any other value** (e.g. number `5`) adds "replace with `5`" to the queue, ignoring what's already queued.

After the event handler completes, React will trigger a re-render. During the re-render, React will process the queue. Updater functions run during rendering, so **updater functions must be [pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure)** and only *return* the result. Don't try to set state from inside of them or run other side effects. In Strict Mode, React will run each updater function twice (but discard the second result) to help you find mistakes.

### Naming conventions {/*naming-conventions*/}

It's common to name the updater function argument by the first letters of the corresponding state variable:

```js
setEnabled(e => !e);
setLastName(ln => ln.reverse());
setFriendCount(fc => fc * 2);
```

If you prefer more verbose code, another common convention is to repeat the full state variable name, like `setEnabled(enabled => !enabled)`, or to use a prefix like `setEnabled(prevEnabled => !prevEnabled)`.

* Setting state does not change the variable in the existing render, but it requests a new render.
* React processes state updates after event handlers have finished running. This is called batching.
* To update some state multiple times in one event, you can use `setNumber(n => n + 1)` updater function.





# Updating Objects In State

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn't change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.

- How to correctly update an object in React state
- How to update a nested object without mutating it
- What immutability is, and how not to break it
- How to make object copying less repetitive with Immer

## What's a mutation? {/*whats-a-mutation*/}

You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.

```js
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
```

So far you've been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are "immutable", meaning unchangeable or "read-only". You can trigger a re-render to _replace_ a value:

```js
setX(5);
```

The `x` state changed from `0` to `5`, but the _number `0` itself_ did not change. It's not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.

Now consider an object in state:

```js
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

Technically, it is possible to change the contents of _the object itself_. **This is called a mutation:**

```js
position.x = 5;
```

However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them **as if** they were immutable--like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.

## Treat state as read-only {/*treat-state-as-read-only*/}

In other words, you should **treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.**

This example holds an object in state to represent the current pointer position. The red dot is supposed to move when you touch or move the cursor over the preview area. But the dot stays in the initial position:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


The problem is with this bit of code.

```js
onPointerMove={e => {
  position.x = e.clientX;
  position.y = e.clientY;
}}
```

This code modifies the object assigned to `position` from [the previous render.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time) But without using the state setting function, React has no idea that object has changed. So React does not do anything in response. It's like trying to change the order after you've already eaten the meal. While mutating state can work in some cases, we don't recommend it. You should treat the state value you have access to in a render as read-only.

To actually [trigger a re-render](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#setting-state-triggers-renders) in this case, **create a *new* object and pass it to the state setting function:**

```js
onPointerMove={e => {
  setPosition({
    x: e.clientX,
    y: e.clientY
  });
}}
```

With `setPosition`, you're telling React:

Mutating an object you've just created is okay because *no other code references it yet.* Changing it isn't going to accidentally impact something that depends on it. This is called a "local mutation". You can even do local mutation [while rendering.](/learn/keeping-components-pure#local-mutation-your-components-little-secret) Very convenient and completely okay!
  

## Copying objects with the spread syntax {/*copying-objects-with-the-spread-syntax*/}

In the previous example, the `position` object is always created fresh from the current cursor position. But often, you will want to include *existing* data as a part of the new object you're creating. For example, you may want to update *only one* field in a form, but keep the previous values for all other fields.

These input fields don't work because the `onChange` handlers mutate the state:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:

```js
person.firstName = e.target.value;
```

The reliable way to get the behavior you're looking for is to create a new object and pass it to `setPerson`. But here, you want to also **copy the existing data into it** because only one of the fields has changed:

```js
setPerson({
  firstName: e.target.value, // New first name from the input
  lastName: person.lastName,
  email: person.email
});
```

You can use the `...` [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_object_literals) syntax so that you don't need to copy every property separately.

```js
setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy the old fields
  firstName: e.target.value // But override this one
});
```

Now the form works! 

Notice how you didn't declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms, keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient--as long as you update it correctly!

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Note that the `...` spread syntax is "shallow"--it only copies things one level deep. This makes it fast, but it also means that if you want to update a nested property, you'll have to use it more than once. 

> **Deep Dive: Using a single event handler for multiple fields {/*using-a-single-event-handler-for-multiple-fields*/}**

## Updating a nested object {/*updating-a-nested-object*/}

Consider a nested object structure like this:

```js
const [person, setPerson] = useState({
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: {
    title: 'Blue Nana',
    city: 'Hamburg',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
  }
});
```

If you wanted to update `person.artwork.city`, it's clear how to do it with mutation:

```js
person.artwork.city = 'New Delhi';
```

But in React, you treat state as immutable! In order to change `city`, you would first need to produce the new `artwork` object (pre-populated with data from the previous one), and then produce the new `person` object which points at the new `artwork`:

```js
const nextArtwork = { ...person.artwork, city: 'New Delhi' };
const nextPerson = { ...person, artwork: nextArtwork };
setPerson(nextPerson);
```

Or, written as a single function call:

```js
setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy other fields
  artwork: { // but replace the artwork
    ...person.artwork, // with the same one
    city: 'New Delhi' // but in New Delhi!
  }
});
```

This gets a bit wordy, but it works fine for many cases:

> If you were to mutate `obj3.artwork.city`, it would affect both `obj2.artwork.city` and `obj1.city`. This is because `obj3.artwork`, `obj2.artwork`, and `obj1` are the same object. This is difficult to see when you think of objects as "nested". Instead, they are separate objects "pointing" at each other with properties.
  

### Write concise update logic with Immer {/*write-concise-update-logic-with-immer*/}

If your state is deeply nested, you might want to consider [flattening it.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-deeply-nested-state) But, if you don't want to change your state structure, you might prefer a shortcut to nested spreads. [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) is a popular library that lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you. With Immer, the code you write looks like you are "breaking the rules" and mutating an object:

```js
updatePerson(draft => {
  draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';
});
```

But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn't overwrite the past state!

> **Deep Dive: How does Immer work? {/*how-does-immer-work*/}**
>
> The `draft` provided by Immer is a special type of object, called a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), that "records" what you do with it. This is why you can mutate it freely as much as you like! Under the hood, Immer figures out which parts of the `draft` have been changed, and produces a completely new object that contains your edits.


To try Immer:

1. Run `npm install use-immer` to add Immer as a dependency
2. Then replace `import { useState } from 'react'` with `import { useImmer } from 'use-immer'`

Here is the above example converted to Immer:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Notice how much more concise the event handlers have become. You can mix and match `useState` and `useImmer` in a single component as much as you like. Immer is a great way to keep the update handlers concise, especially if there's nesting in your state, and copying objects leads to repetitive code.

> **Deep Dive: Why is mutating state not recommended in React? {/*why-is-mutating-state-not-recommended-in-react*/}**
>
> There are a few reasons:
> 
> * **Debugging:** If you use `console.log` and don't mutate state, your past logs won't get clobbered by the more recent state changes. So you can clearly see how state has changed between renders.
> * **Optimizations:** Common React [optimization strategies](/reference/react/memo) rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If `prevObj === obj`, you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it.
> * **New Features:** The new React features we're building rely on state being [treated like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) If you're mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features.
> * **Requirement Changes:** Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a history of changes, or letting the user reset a form to earlier values, are easier to do when nothing is mutated. This is because you can keep past copies of state in memory, and reuse them when appropriate. If you start with a mutative approach, features like this can be difficult to add later on.
> * **Simpler Implementation:** Because React does not rely on mutation, it does not need to do anything special with your objects. It does not need to hijack their properties, always wrap them into Proxies, or do other work at initialization as many "reactive" solutions do. This is also why React lets you put any object into state--no matter how large--without additional performance or correctness pitfalls.
> 
> In practice, you can often "get away" with mutating state in React, but we strongly advise you not to do that so that you can use new React features developed with this approach in mind. Future contributors and perhaps even your future self will thank you!


* Treat all state in React as immutable.
* When you store objects in state, mutating them will not trigger renders and will change the state in previous render "snapshots".
* Instead of mutating an object, create a *new* version of it, and trigger a re-render by setting state to it.
* You can use the `{...obj, something: 'newValue'}` object spread syntax to create copies of objects.
* Spread syntax is shallow: it only copies one level deep.
* To update a nested object, you need to create copies all the way up from the place you're updating.
* To reduce repetitive copying code, use Immer.






# Updating Arrays In State

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.

- How to add, remove, or change items in an array in React state
- How to update an object inside of an array
- How to make array copying less repetitive with Immer

## Updating arrays without mutation {/*updating-arrays-without-mutation*/}

In JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. [Like with objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state), **you should treat arrays in React state as read-only.** This means that you shouldn't reassign items inside an array like `arr[0] = 'bird'`, and you also shouldn't use methods that mutate the array, such as `push()` and `pop()`.

Instead, every time you want to update an array, you'll want to pass a *new* array to your state setting function. To do that, you can create a new array from the original array in your state by calling its non-mutating methods like `filter()` and `map()`. Then you can set your state to the resulting new array.

Here is a reference table of common array operations. When dealing with arrays inside React state, you will need to avoid the methods in the left column, and instead prefer the methods in the right column:

|           | avoid (mutates the array)           | prefer (returns a new array)                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| adding    | `push`, `unshift`                   | `concat`, `[...arr]` spread syntax ([example](#adding-to-an-array)) |
| removing  | `pop`, `shift`, `splice`            | `filter`, `slice` ([example](#removing-from-an-array))              |
| replacing | `splice`, `arr[i] = ...` assignment | `map` ([example](#replacing-items-in-an-array))                     |
| sorting   | `reverse`, `sort`                   | copy the array first ([example](#making-other-changes-to-an-array)) |

Alternatively, you can [use Immer](#write-concise-update-logic-with-immer) which lets you use methods from both columns.

### Adding to an array {/*adding-to-an-array*/}

`push()` will mutate an array, which you don't want:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Instead, create a *new* array which contains the existing items *and* a new item at the end. There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest one is to use the `...` [array spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_array_literals) syntax:

```js
setArtists( // Replace the state
  [ // with a new array
    ...artists, // that contains all the old items
    { id: nextId++, name: name } // and one new item at the end
  ]
);
```

Now it works correctly:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


The array spread syntax also lets you prepend an item by placing it *before* the original `...artists`:

```js
setArtists([
  { id: nextId++, name: name },
  ...artists // Put old items at the end
]);
```

In this way, spread can do the job of both `push()` by adding to the end of an array and `unshift()` by adding to the beginning of an array. Try it in the sandbox above!

### Removing from an array {/*removing-from-an-array*/}

The easiest way to remove an item from an array is to *filter it out*. In other words, you will produce a new array that will not contain that item. To do this, use the `filter` method, for example:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Click the "Delete" button a few times, and look at its click handler.

```js
setArtists(
  artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)
);
```

Here, `artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)` means "create an array that consists of those `artists` whose IDs are different from `artist.id`". In other words, each artist's "Delete" button will filter _that_ artist out of the array, and then request a re-render with the resulting array. Note that `filter` does not modify the original array.

### Transforming an array {/*transforming-an-array*/}

If you want to change some or all items of the array, you can use `map()` to create a **new** array. The function you will pass to `map` can decide what to do with each item, based on its data or its index (or both).

In this example, an array holds coordinates of two circles and a square. When you press the button, it moves only the circles down by 50 pixels. It does this by producing a new array of data using `map()`:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


### Replacing items in an array {/*replacing-items-in-an-array*/}

It is particularly common to want to replace one or more items in an array. Assignments like `arr[0] = 'bird'` are mutating the original array, so instead you'll want to use `map` for this as well.

To replace an item, create a new array with `map`. Inside your `map` call, you will receive the item index as the second argument. Use it to decide whether to return the original item (the first argument) or something else:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


### Inserting into an array {/*inserting-into-an-array*/}

Sometimes, you may want to insert an item at a particular position that's neither at the beginning nor at the end. To do this, you can use the `...` array spread syntax together with the `slice()` method. The `slice()` method lets you cut a "slice" of the array. To insert an item, you will create an array that spreads the slice _before_ the insertion point, then the new item, and then the rest of the original array.

In this example, the Insert button always inserts at the index `1`:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


### Making other changes to an array {/*making-other-changes-to-an-array*/}

There are some things you can't do with the spread syntax and non-mutating methods like `map()` and `filter()` alone. For example, you may want to reverse or sort an array. The JavaScript `reverse()` and `sort()` methods are mutating the original array, so you can't use them directly.

**However, you can copy the array first, and then make changes to it.**

For example:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Here, you use the `[...list]` spread syntax to create a copy of the original array first. Now that you have a copy, you can use mutating methods like `nextList.reverse()` or `nextList.sort()`, or even assign individual items with `nextList[0] = "something"`.

However, **even if you copy an array, you can't mutate existing items _inside_ of it directly.** This is because copying is shallow--the new array will contain the same items as the original one. So if you modify an object inside the copied array, you are mutating the existing state. For example, code like this is a problem.

```js
const nextList = [...list];
nextList[0].seen = true; // Problem: mutates list[0]
setList(nextList);
```

Although `nextList` and `list` are two different arrays, **`nextList[0]` and `list[0]` point to the same object.** So by changing `nextList[0].seen`, you are also changing `list[0].seen`. This is a state mutation, which you should avoid! You can solve this issue in a similar way to [updating nested JavaScript objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state#updating-a-nested-object)--by copying individual items you want to change instead of mutating them. Here's how.

## Updating objects inside arrays {/*updating-objects-inside-arrays*/}

Objects are not _really_ located "inside" arrays. They might appear to be "inside" in code, but each object in an array is a separate value, to which the array "points". This is why you need to be careful when changing nested fields like `list[0]`. Another person's artwork list may point to the same element of the array!

**When updating nested state, you need to create copies from the point where you want to update, and all the way up to the top level.** Let's see how this works.

In this example, two separate artwork lists have the same initial state. They are supposed to be isolated, but because of a mutation, their state is accidentally shared, and checking a box in one list affects the other list:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


The problem is in code like this:

```js
const myNextList = [...myList];
const artwork = myNextList.find(a => a.id === artworkId);
artwork.seen = nextSeen; // Problem: mutates an existing item
setMyList(myNextList);
```

Although the `myNextList` array itself is new, the *items themselves* are the same as in the original `myList` array. So changing `artwork.seen` changes the *original* artwork item. That artwork item is also in `yourList`, which causes the bug. Bugs like this can be difficult to think about, but thankfully they disappear if you avoid mutating state.

**You can use `map` to substitute an old item with its updated version without mutation.**

```js
setMyList(myList.map(artwork => {
  if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
    // Create a *new* object with changes
    return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
  } else {
    // No changes
    return artwork;
  }
}));
```

Here, `...` is the object spread syntax used to [create a copy of an object.](/learn/updating-objects-in-state#copying-objects-with-the-spread-syntax)

With this approach, none of the existing state items are being mutated, and the bug is fixed:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


In general, **you should only mutate objects that you have just created.** If you were inserting a *new* artwork, you could mutate it, but if you're dealing with something that's already in state, you need to make a copy.

### Write concise update logic with Immer {/*write-concise-update-logic-with-immer*/}

Updating nested arrays without mutation can get a little bit repetitive. [Just as with objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state#write-concise-update-logic-with-immer):

- Generally, you shouldn't need to update state more than a couple of levels deep. If your state objects are very deep, you might want to [restructure them differently](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-deeply-nested-state) so that they are flat.
- If you don't want to change your state structure, you might prefer to use [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer), which lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you.

Here is the Art Bucket List example rewritten with Immer:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Note how with Immer, **mutation like `artwork.seen = nextSeen` is now okay:**

```js
updateMyTodos(draft => {
  const artwork = draft.find(a => a.id === artworkId);
  artwork.seen = nextSeen;
});
```

This is because you're not mutating the _original_ state, but you're mutating a special `draft` object provided by Immer. Similarly, you can apply mutating methods like `push()` and `pop()` to the content of the `draft`.

Behind the scenes, Immer always constructs the next state from scratch according to the changes that you've done to the `draft`. This keeps your event handlers very concise without ever mutating state.

- You can put arrays into state, but you can't change them.
- Instead of mutating an array, create a *new* version of it, and update the state to it.
- You can use the `[...arr, newItem]` array spread syntax to create arrays with new items.
- You can use `filter()` and `map()` to create new arrays with filtered or transformed items.
- You can use Immer to keep your code concise.






# Usestate

`useState` is a React Hook that lets you add a [state variable](/learn/state-a-components-memory) to your component.

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

<InlineToc />

---

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useState(initialState)` {/*usestate*/}

Call `useState` at the top level of your component to declare a [state variable.](/learn/state-a-components-memory)

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(28);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => createTodos());
  // ...
```

The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using [array destructuring.](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `initialState`: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
  * If you pass a function as `initialState`, it will be treated as an _initializer function_. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. [See an example below.](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state)

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useState` returns an array with exactly two values:

1. The current state. During the first render, it will match the `initialState` you have passed.
2. The [`set` function](#setstate) that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useState` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
* In Strict Mode, React will **call your initializer function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your initializer function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.

---

### `set` functions, like `setSomething(nextState)` {/*setstate*/}

The `set` function returned by `useState` lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:

```js
const [name, setName] = useState('Edward');

function handleClick() {
  setName('Taylor');
  setAge(a => a + 1);
  // ...
```

#### Parameters {/*setstate-parameters*/}

* `nextState`: The value that you want the state to be. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions.
  * If you pass a function as `nextState`, it will be treated as an _updater function_. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. [See an example below.](#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state)

#### Returns {/*setstate-returns*/}

`set` functions do not have a return value.

#### Caveats {/*setstate-caveats*/}

* The `set` function **only updates the state variable for the *next* render**. If you read the state variable after calling the `set` function, [you will still get the old value](#ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value) that was on the screen before your call.

* If the new value you provide is identical to the current `state`, as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison, React will **skip re-rendering the component and its children.** This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn't affect your code.

* React [batches state updates.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) It updates the screen **after all the event handlers have run** and have called their `set` functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use [`flushSync`.](/reference/react-dom/flushSync)

* The `set` function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)

* Calling the `set` function *during rendering* is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to **store information from the previous renders**. [See an example below.](#storing-information-from-previous-renders)

* In Strict Mode, React will **call your updater function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your updater function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Adding state to a component {/*adding-state-to-a-component*/}

Call `useState` at the top level of your component to declare one or more [state variables.](/learn/state-a-components-memory)

```js [[1, 4, "age"], [2, 4, "setAge"], [3, 4, "42"], [1, 5, "name"], [2, 5, "setName"], [3, 5, "'Taylor'"]]
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
  // ...
```

The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using [array destructuring.](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)

`useState` returns an array with exactly two items:

1. The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.
2. The `set` function that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.

To update what’s on the screen, call the `set` function with some next state:

```js [[2, 2, "setName"]]
function handleClick() {
  setName('Robin');
}
```

React will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.

#### Text field (string) {/*text-field-string*/}

In this example, the `text` state variable holds a string. When you type, `handleChange` reads the latest input value from the browser input DOM element, and calls `setText` to update the state. This allows you to display the current `text` below.

#### Checkbox (boolean) {/*checkbox-boolean*/}

In this example, the `liked` state variable holds a boolean. When you click the input, `setLiked` updates the `liked` state variable with whether the browser checkbox input is checked. The `liked` variable is used to render the text below the checkbox.

### Updating state based on the previous state {/*updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state*/}

Suppose the `age` is `42`. This handler calls `setAge(age + 1)` three times:

```js
function handleClick() {
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
}
```

However, after one click, `age` will only be `43` rather than `45`! This is because calling the `set` function [does not update](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) the `age` state variable in the already running code. So each `setAge(age + 1)` call becomes `setAge(43)`.

To solve this problem, **you may pass an *updater function*** to `setAge` instead of the next state:

```js [[1, 2, "a", 0], [2, 2, "a + 1"], [1, 3, "a", 0], [2, 3, "a + 1"], [1, 4, "a", 0], [2, 4, "a + 1"]]
function handleClick() {
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)
}
```

Here, `a => a + 1` is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.

React puts your updater functions in a [queue.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:

1. `a => a + 1` will receive `42` as the pending state and return `43` as the next state.
1. `a => a + 1` will receive `43` as the pending state and return `44` as the next state.
1. `a => a + 1` will receive `44` as the pending state and return `45` as the next state.

There are no other queued updates, so React will store `45` as the current state in the end.

By convention, it's common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like `a` for `age`. However, you may also call it like `prevAge` or something else that you find clearer.

React may [call your updaters twice](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) in development to verify that they are [pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

> **Deep Dive: Is using an updater always preferred? {/*is-using-an-updater-always-preferred*/}**
>
> You might hear a recommendation to always write code like `setAge(a => a + 1)` if the state you're setting is calculated from the previous state. There is no harm in it, but it is also not always necessary.
> 
> In most cases, there is no difference between these two approaches. React always makes sure that for intentional user actions, like clicks, the `age` state variable would be updated before the next click. This means there is no risk of a click handler seeing a "stale" `age` at the beginning of the event handler.
> 
> However, if you do multiple updates within the same event, updaters can be helpful. They're also helpful if accessing the state variable itself is inconvenient (you might run into this when optimizing re-renders).
> 
> If you prefer consistency over slightly more verbose syntax, it's reasonable to always write an updater if the state you're setting is calculated from the previous state. If it's calculated from the previous state of some *other* state variable, you might want to combine them into one object and [use a reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

### Updating objects and arrays in state {/*updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state*/}

You can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so **you should *replace* it rather than *mutate* your existing objects**. For example, if you have a `form` object in state, don't mutate it:

```js
// 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:
form.firstName = 'Taylor';
```

Instead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:

```js
// ✅ Replace state with a new object
setForm({
  ...form,
  firstName: 'Taylor'
});
```

Read [updating objects in state](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays in state](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) to learn more.

<Recipes titleText="Examples of objects and arrays in state" titleId="examples-objects">

#### Form (object) {/*form-object*/}

In this example, the `form` state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls `setForm` with the next state of the entire form. The `{ ...form }` spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


<Solution />

#### Form (nested object) {/*form-nested-object*/}

In this example, the state is more nested. When you update nested state, you need to create a copy of the object you're updating, as well as any objects "containing" it on the way upwards. Read [updating a nested object](/learn/updating-objects-in-state#updating-a-nested-object) to learn more.

#### List (array) {/*list-array*/}

In this example, the `todos` state variable holds an array. Each button handler calls `setTodos` with the next version of that array. The `[...todos]` spread syntax, `todos.map()` and `todos.filter()` ensure the state array is replaced rather than mutated.

#### Writing concise update logic with Immer {/*writing-concise-update-logic-with-immer*/}

If updating arrays and objects without mutation feels tedious, you can use a library like [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) to reduce repetitive code. Immer lets you write concise code as if you were mutating objects, but under the hood it performs immutable updates:

### Avoiding recreating the initial state {/*avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state*/}

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

```js
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos());
  // ...
```

Although the result of `createInitialTodos()` is only used for the initial render, you're still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it's creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useState` instead:

```js
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);
  // ...
```

Notice that you’re passing `createInitialTodos`, which is the *function itself*, and not `createInitialTodos()`, which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to `useState`, React will only call it during initialization.

React may [call your initializers twice](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) in development to verify that they are [pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

<Recipes titleText="The difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly" titleId="examples-initializer">

#### Passing the initializer function {/*passing-the-initializer-function*/}

This example passes the initializer function, so the `createInitialTodos` function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.

### Resetting state with a key {/*resetting-state-with-a-key*/}

You'll often encounter the `key` attribute when [rendering lists.](/learn/rendering-lists) However, it also serves another purpose.

You can **reset a component's state by passing a different `key` to a component.** In this example, the Reset button changes the `version` state variable, which we pass as a `key` to the `Form`. When the `key` changes, React re-creates the `Form` component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.

### Storing information from previous renders {/*storing-information-from-previous-renders*/}

Usually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering -- for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.

In most cases, you don't need this:

* **If the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, [remove that redundant state altogether.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state)** If you're worried about recomputing too often, the [`useMemo` Hook](/reference/react/useMemo) can help.
* If you want to reset the entire component tree's state, [pass a different `key` to your component.](#resetting-state-with-a-key)
* If you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers.

In the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a `set` function while your component is rendering.

Here's an example. This `CountLabel` component displays the `count` prop passed to it:

```js src/CountLabel.js
export default function CountLabel({ count }) {
  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}
```

Say you want to show whether the counter has *increased or decreased* since the last change. The `count` prop doesn't tell you this -- you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the `prevCount` state variable to track it. Add another state variable called `trend` to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare `prevCount` with `count`, and if they're not equal, update both `prevCount` and `trend`. Now you can show both the current count prop and *how it has changed since the last render*.

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Note that if you call a `set` function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like `prevCount !== count`, and there must be a call like `setPrevCount(count)` inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the *currently rendering* component like this. Calling the `set` function of *another* component during rendering is an error. Finally, your `set` call should still [update state without mutation](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state) -- this doesn't mean you can break other rules of [pure functions.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

This pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it's better than updating state in an effect. When you call the `set` function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a `return` statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don't need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early `return;` to restart rendering earlier.

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### I've updated the state, but logging gives me the old value {/*ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value*/}

Calling the `set` function **does not change state in the running code**:

```js {4,5,8}
function handleClick() {
  console.log(count);  // 0

  setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1
  console.log(count);  // Still 0!

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(count); // Also 0!
  }, 5000);
}
```

This is because [states behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the `count` JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.

If you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the `set` function:

```js
const nextCount = count + 1;
setCount(nextCount);

console.log(count);     // 0
console.log(nextCount); // 1
```

---

### I've updated the state, but the screen doesn't update {/*ive-updated-the-state-but-the-screen-doesnt-update*/}

React will **ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state,** as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:

```js
obj.x = 10;  // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object
setObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything
```

You mutated an existing `obj` object and passed it back to `setObj`, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you're always [_replacing_ objects and arrays in state instead of _mutating_ them](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

```js
// ✅ Correct: creating a new object
setObj({
  ...obj,
  x: 10
});
```

---

### I'm getting an error: "Too many re-renders" {/*im-getting-an-error-too-many-re-renders*/}

You might get an error that says: `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.` Typically, this means that you're unconditionally setting state *during render*, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:

```js {1-2}
// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render
return <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>

// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler
return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function
return <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>
```

If you can't find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific `set` function call responsible for the error.

---

### My initializer or updater function runs twice {/*my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice*/}

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:

```js {2,5-6,11-12}
function TodoList() {
  // This component function will run twice for every render.

  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => {
    // This initializer function will run twice during initialization.
    return createTodos();
  });

  function handleClick() {
    setTodos(prevTodos => {
      // This updater function will run twice for every click.
      return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];
    });
  }
  // ...
```

This is expected and shouldn't break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn't affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.

For example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:

```js {2,3}
setTodos(prevTodos => {
  // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state
  prevTodos.push(createTodo());
});
```

Because React calls your updater function twice, you'll see the todo was added twice, so you'll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by [replacing the array instead of mutating it](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

```js {2,3}
setTodos(prevTodos => {
  // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state
  return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];
});
```

Now that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn't make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. **Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure.** Event handlers don't need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

### I'm trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead {/*im-trying-to-set-state-to-a-function-but-it-gets-called-instead*/}

You can't put a function into state like this:

```js
const [fn, setFn] = useState(someFunction);

function handleClick() {
  setFn(someOtherFunction);
}
```

Because you're passing a function, React assumes that `someFunction` is an [initializer function](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state), and that `someOtherFunction` is an [updater function](#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state), so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually *store* a function, you have to put `() =>` before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.

```js {1,4}
const [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);

function handleClick() {
  setFn(() => someOtherFunction);
}
```
