# Synchronizing With Effects

Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. *Effects* let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.

## What are Effects and how are they different from events? {/*what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events*/}

Before getting to Effects, you need to be familiar with two types of logic inside React components:

- **Rendering code** (introduced in [Describing the UI](/learn/describing-the-ui)) lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. [Rendering code must be pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) Like a math formula, it should only _calculate_ the result, but not do anything else.

- **Event handlers** (introduced in [Adding Interactivity](/learn/adding-interactivity)) are nested functions inside your components that *do* things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain ["side effects"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)) (they change the program's state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).

Sometimes this isn't enough. Consider a `ChatRoom` component that must connect to the chat server whenever it's visible on the screen. Connecting to a server is not a pure calculation (it's a side effect) so it can't happen during rendering. However, there is no single particular event like a click that causes `ChatRoom` to be displayed.

***Effects* let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event.** Sending a message in the chat is an *event* because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection is an *Effect* because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a [commit](/learn/render-and-commit) after the screen updates. This is a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library).

## You might not need an Effect {/*you-might-not-need-an-effect*/}

**Don't rush to add Effects to your components.** Keep in mind that Effects are typically used to "step out" of your React code and synchronize with some *external* system. This includes browser APIs, third-party widgets, network, and so on. If your Effect only adjusts some state based on other state, [you might not need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

## How to write an Effect {/*how-to-write-an-effect*/}

To write an Effect, follow these three steps:

1. **Declare an Effect.** By default, your Effect will run after every [commit](/learn/render-and-commit).
2. **Specify the Effect dependencies.** Most Effects should only re-run *when needed* rather than after every render. For example, a fade-in animation should only trigger when a component appears. Connecting and disconnecting to a chat room should only happen when the component appears and disappears, or when the chat room changes. You will learn how to control this by specifying *dependencies.*
3. **Add cleanup if needed.** Some Effects need to specify how to stop, undo, or clean up whatever they were doing. For example, "connect" needs "disconnect", "subscribe" needs "unsubscribe", and "fetch" needs either "cancel" or "ignore". You will learn how to do this by returning a *cleanup function*.

Let's look at each of these steps in detail.

### Step 1: Declare an Effect {/*step-1-declare-an-effect*/}

To declare an Effect in your component, import the [`useEffect` Hook](/reference/react/useEffect) from React:

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

Then, call it at the top level of your component and put some code inside your Effect:

```js {2-4}
function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code here will run after *every* render
  });
  return <div />;
}
```

Every time your component renders, React will update the screen *and then* run the code inside `useEffect`. In other words, **`useEffect` "delays" a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.**

Let's see how you can use an Effect to synchronize with an external system. Consider a `<VideoPlayer>` React component. It would be nice to control whether it's playing or paused by passing an `isPlaying` prop to it:

```js
<VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} />;
```

Your custom `VideoPlayer` component renders the built-in browser [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) tag:

```js
function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  // TODO: do something with isPlaying
  return <video src={src} />;
}
```

However, the browser `<video>` tag does not have an `isPlaying` prop. The only way to control it is to manually call the [`play()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/play) and [`pause()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/pause) methods on the DOM element. **You need to synchronize the value of `isPlaying` prop, which tells whether the video _should_ currently be playing, with calls like `play()` and `pause()`.**

We'll need to first [get a ref](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs) to the `<video>` DOM node.

You might be tempted to try to call `play()` or `pause()` during rendering, but that isn't correct:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


The reason this code isn't correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React, [rendering should be a pure calculation](/learn/keeping-components-pure) of JSX and should not contain side effects like modifying the DOM.

Moreover, when `VideoPlayer` is called for the first time, its DOM does not exist yet! There isn't a DOM node yet to call `play()` or `pause()` on, because React doesn't know what DOM to create until you return the JSX.

The solution here is to **wrap the side effect with `useEffect` to move it out of the rendering calculation:**

```js {6,12}
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  });

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}
```

By wrapping the DOM update in an Effect, you let React update the screen first. Then your Effect runs.

When your `VideoPlayer` component renders (either the first time or if it re-renders), a few things will happen. First, React will update the screen, ensuring the `<video>` tag is in the DOM with the right props. Then React will run your Effect. Finally, your Effect will call `play()` or `pause()` depending on the value of `isPlaying`.

Press Play/Pause multiple times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the `isPlaying` value:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


In this example, the "external system" you synchronized to React state was the browser media API. You can use a similar approach to wrap legacy non-React code (like jQuery plugins) into declarative React components.

Note that controlling a video player is much more complex in practice. Calling `play()` may fail, the user might play or pause using the built-in browser controls, and so on. This example is very simplified and incomplete.

> 
> 


### Step 2: Specify the Effect dependencies {/*step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies*/}

By default, Effects run after *every* render. Often, this is **not what you want:**

- Sometimes, it's slow. Synchronizing with an external system is not always instant, so you might want to skip doing it unless it's necessary. For example, you don't want to reconnect to the chat server on every keystroke.
- Sometimes, it's wrong. For example, you don't want to trigger a component fade-in animation on every keystroke. The animation should only play once when the component appears for the first time.

To demonstrate the issue, here is the previous example with a few `console.log` calls and a text input that updates the parent component's state. Notice how typing causes the Effect to re-run:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


You can tell React to **skip unnecessarily re-running the Effect** by specifying an array of *dependencies* as the second argument to the `useEffect` call. Start by adding an empty `[]` array to the above example on line 14:

```js {3}
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
```

You should see an error saying `React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying'`:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


The problem is that the code inside of your Effect *depends on* the `isPlaying` prop to decide what to do, but this dependency was not explicitly declared. To fix this issue, add `isPlaying` to the dependency array:

```js {2,7}
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) { // It's used here...
      // ...
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  }, [isPlaying]); // ...so it must be declared here!
```

Now all dependencies are declared, so there is no error. Specifying `[isPlaying]` as the dependency array tells React that it should skip re-running your Effect if `isPlaying` is the same as it was during the previous render. With this change, typing into the input doesn't cause the Effect to re-run, but pressing Play/Pause does:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


The dependency array can contain multiple dependencies. React will only skip re-running the Effect if *all* of the dependencies you specify have exactly the same values as they had during the previous render. React compares the dependency values using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. See the [`useEffect` reference](/reference/react/useEffect#reference) for details.

**Notice that you can't "choose" your dependencies.** You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don't match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect. This helps catch many bugs in your code. If you don't want some code to re-run, [*edit the Effect code itself* to not "need" that dependency.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-to-do-when-you-dont-want-to-re-synchronize)

> **Pitfall:**

> 
>

> **Deep Dive: Why was the ref omitted from the dependency array? {/*why-was-the-ref-omitted-from-the-dependency-array*/}**
>
> This Effect uses _both_ `ref` and `isPlaying`, but only `isPlaying` is declared as a dependency:

>     }
>   }, [isPlaying]);
> ```
> 
> This is because the `ref` object has a *stable identity:* React guarantees [you'll always get the same object](/reference/react/useRef#returns) from the same `useRef` call on every render. It never changes, so it will never by itself cause the Effect to re-run. Therefore, it does not matter whether you include it or not. Including it is fine too:
> 
> ```js {9}
> function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
>   const ref = useRef(null);
>   useEffect(() => {
>     if (isPlaying) {
>       ref.current.play();
>     } else {
>       ref.current.pause();
>     }
>   }, [isPlaying, ref]);
> ```
> 
> The [`set` functions](/reference/react/useState#setstate) returned by `useState` also have stable identity, so you will often see them omitted from the dependencies too. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do.
> 
> Omitting always-stable dependencies only works when the linter can "see" that the object is stable. For example, if `ref` was passed from a parent component, you would have to specify it in the dependency array. However, this is good because you can't know whether the parent component always passes the same ref, or passes one of several refs conditionally. So your Effect _would_ depend on which ref is passed.


### Step 3: Add cleanup if needed {/*step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed*/}

Consider a different example. You're writing a `ChatRoom` component that needs to connect to the chat server when it appears. You are given a `createConnection()` API that returns an object with `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods. How do you keep the component connected while it is displayed to the user?

Start by writing the Effect logic:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  connection.connect();
});
```

It would be slow to connect to the chat after every re-render, so you add the dependency array:

```js {4}
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  connection.connect();
}, []);
```

**The code inside the Effect does not use any props or state, so your dependency array is `[]` (empty). This tells React to only run this code when the component "mounts", i.e. appears on the screen for the first time.**

Let's try running this code:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


This Effect only runs on mount, so you might expect `"✅ Connecting..."` to be printed once in the console. **However, if you check the console, `"✅ Connecting..."` gets printed twice. Why does it happen?**

Imagine the `ChatRoom` component is a part of a larger app with many different screens. The user starts their journey on the `ChatRoom` page. The component mounts and calls `connection.connect()`. Then imagine the user navigates to another screen--for example, to the Settings page. The `ChatRoom` component unmounts. Finally, the user clicks Back and `ChatRoom` mounts again. This would set up a second connection--but the first connection was never destroyed! As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up.

Bugs like this are easy to miss without extensive manual testing. To help you spot them quickly, in development React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount.

Seeing the `"✅ Connecting..."` log twice helps you notice the real issue: your code doesn't close the connection when the component unmounts.

To fix the issue, return a *cleanup function* from your Effect:

```js {4-6}
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []);
```

React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed). Let's see what happens when the cleanup function is implemented:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Now you get three console logs in development:

1. `"✅ Connecting..."`
2. `"❌ Disconnected."`
3. `"✅ Connecting..."`

**This is the correct behavior in development.** By remounting your component, React verifies that navigating away and back would not break your code. Disconnecting and then connecting again is exactly what should happen! When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again. There's an extra connect/disconnect call pair because React is probing your code for bugs in development. This is normal--don't try to make it go away!

**In production, you would only see `"✅ Connecting..."` printed once.** Remounting components only happens in development to help you find Effects that need cleanup. You can turn off [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) to opt out of the development behavior, but we recommend keeping it on. This lets you find many bugs like the one above.

## How to handle the Effect firing twice in development? {/*how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development*/}

React intentionally remounts your components in development to find bugs like in the last example. **The right question isn't "how to run an Effect once", but "how to fix my Effect so that it works after remounting".**

Usually, the answer is to implement the cleanup function.  The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the Effect was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn't be able to distinguish between the Effect running once (as in production) and a _setup → cleanup → setup_ sequence (as you'd see in development).

Most of the Effects you'll write will fit into one of the common patterns below.

> **Pitfall: Don't use refs to prevent Effects from firing {/*dont-use-refs-to-prevent-effects-from-firing*/}**
>
> A common pitfall for preventing Effects firing twice in development is to use a `ref` to prevent the Effect from running more than once. For example, you could "fix" the above bug with a `useRef`:

> ```js {1,3-4}

>   useEffect(() => {
>     // 🚩 This wont fix the bug!!!

>     }
>   }, []);
> ```
> 
> This makes it so you only see `"✅ Connecting..."` once in development, but it doesn't fix the bug.
> 
> When the user navigates away, the connection still isn't closed and when they navigate back, a new connection is created. As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up, the same as it would before the "fix".
> 
> To fix the bug, it is not enough to just make the Effect run once. The effect needs to work after re-mounting, which means the connection needs to be cleaned up like in the solution above.
> 
> See the examples below for how to handle common patterns.


### Controlling non-React widgets {/*controlling-non-react-widgets*/}

Sometimes you need to add UI widgets that aren't written in React. For example, let's say you're adding a map component to your page. It has a `setZoomLevel()` method, and you'd like to keep the zoom level in sync with a `zoomLevel` state variable in your React code. Your Effect would look similar to this:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const map = mapRef.current;
  map.setZoomLevel(zoomLevel);
}, [zoomLevel]);
```

Note that there is no cleanup needed in this case. In development, React will call the Effect twice, but this is not a problem because calling `setZoomLevel` twice with the same value does not do anything. It may be slightly slower, but this doesn't matter because it won't remount needlessly in production.

Some APIs may not allow you to call them twice in a row. For example, the [`showModal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal) method of the built-in [`<dialog>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement) element throws if you call it twice. Implement the cleanup function and make it close the dialog:

```js {4}
useEffect(() => {
  const dialog = dialogRef.current;
  dialog.showModal();
  return () => dialog.close();
}, []);
```

In development, your Effect will call `showModal()`, then immediately `close()`, and then `showModal()` again. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling `showModal()` once, as you would see in production.

### Subscribing to events {/*subscribing-to-events*/}

If your Effect subscribes to something, the cleanup function should unsubscribe:

```js {6}
useEffect(() => {
  function handleScroll(e) {
    console.log(window.scrollX, window.scrollY);
  }
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);
```

In development, your Effect will call `addEventListener()`, then immediately `removeEventListener()`, and then `addEventListener()` again with the same handler. So there would be only one active subscription at a time. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling `addEventListener()` once, as in production.

### Triggering animations {/*triggering-animations*/}

If your Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should reset the animation to the initial values:

```js {4-6}
useEffect(() => {
  const node = ref.current;
  node.style.opacity = 1; // Trigger the animation
  return () => {
    node.style.opacity = 0; // Reset to the initial value
  };
}, []);
```

In development, opacity will be set to `1`, then to `0`, and then to `1` again. This should have the same user-visible behavior as setting it to `1` directly, which is what would happen in production. If you use a third-party animation library with support for tweening, your cleanup function should reset the timeline to its initial state.

### Fetching data {/*fetching-data*/}

If your Effect fetches something, the cleanup function should either [abort the fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) or ignore its result:

```js {2,6,13-15}
useEffect(() => {
  let ignore = false;

  async function startFetching() {
    const json = await fetchTodos(userId);
    if (!ignore) {
      setTodos(json);
    }
  }

  startFetching();

  return () => {
    ignore = true;
  };
}, [userId]);
```

You can't "undo" a network request that already happened, but your cleanup function should ensure that the fetch that's _not relevant anymore_ does not keep affecting your application. If the `userId` changes from `'Alice'` to `'Bob'`, cleanup ensures that the `'Alice'` response is ignored even if it arrives after `'Bob'`.

**In development, you will see two fetches in the Network tab.** There is nothing wrong with that. With the approach above, the first Effect will immediately get cleaned up so its copy of the `ignore` variable will be set to `true`. So even though there is an extra request, it won't affect the state thanks to the `if (!ignore)` check.

**In production, there will only be one request.** If the second request in development is bothering you, the best approach is to use a solution that deduplicates requests and caches their responses between components:

```js
function TodoList() {
  const todos = useSomeDataLibrary(`/api/user/${userId}/todos`);
  // ...
```

This will not only improve the development experience, but also make your application feel faster. For example, the user pressing the Back button won't have to wait for some data to load again because it will be cached. You can either build such a cache yourself or use one of the many alternatives to manual fetching in Effects.

> **Deep Dive: What are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? {/*what-are-good-alternatives-to-data-fetching-in-effects*/}**
>
> Writing `fetch` calls inside Effects is a [popular way to fetch data](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/), especially in fully client-side apps. This is, however, a very manual approach and it has significant downsides:
> 
> - **Effects don't run on the server.** This means that the initial server-rendered HTML will only include a loading state with no data. The client computer will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient.
> - **Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create "network waterfalls".** You render the parent component, it fetches some data, renders the child components, and then they start fetching their data.

> 
> You can continue fetching data directly in Effects if neither of these approaches suit you.


### Sending analytics {/*sending-analytics*/}

Consider this code that sends an analytics event on the page visit:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  logVisit(url); // Sends a POST request
}, [url]);
```

In development, `logVisit` will be called twice for every URL, so you might be tempted to try to fix that. **We recommend keeping this code as is.** Like with earlier examples, there is no *user-visible* behavior difference between running it once and running it twice. From a practical point of view, `logVisit` should not do anything in development because you don't want the logs from the development machines to skew the production metrics. Your component remounts every time you save its file, so it logs extra visits in development anyway.

**In production, there will be no duplicate visit logs.**

To debug the analytics events you're sending, you can deploy your app to a staging environment (which runs in production mode) or temporarily opt out of [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) and its development-only remounting checks. You may also send analytics from the route change event handlers instead of Effects. For more precise analytics, [intersection observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) can help track which components are in the viewport and how long they remain visible.

### Not an Effect: Initializing the application {/*not-an-effect-initializing-the-application*/}

Some logic should only run once when the application starts. You can put it outside your components:

```js {2-3}
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.
  checkAuthToken();
  loadDataFromLocalStorage();
}

function App() {
  // ...
}
```

This guarantees that such logic only runs once after the browser loads the page.

### Not an Effect: Buying a product {/*not-an-effect-buying-a-product*/}

Sometimes, even if you write a cleanup function, there's no way to prevent user-visible consequences of running the Effect twice. For example, maybe your Effect sends a POST request like buying a product:

```js {2-3}
useEffect(() => {
  // 🔴 Wrong: This Effect fires twice in development, exposing a problem in the code.
  fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' });
}, []);
```

You wouldn't want to buy the product twice. However, this is also why you shouldn't put this logic in an Effect. What if the user goes to another page and then presses Back? Your Effect would run again. You don't want to buy the product when the user *visits* a page; you want to buy it when the user *clicks* the Buy button.

Buying is not caused by rendering; it's caused by a specific interaction. It should run only when the user presses the button. **Delete the Effect and move your `/api/buy` request into the Buy button event handler:**

```js {2-3}
  function handleClick() {
    // ✅ Buying is an event because it is caused by a particular interaction.
    fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' });
  }
```

**This illustrates that if remounting breaks the logic of your application, this usually uncovers existing bugs.** From a user's perspective, visiting a page shouldn't be different from visiting it, clicking a link, then pressing Back to view the page again. React verifies that your components abide by this principle by remounting them once in development.

## Putting it all together {/*putting-it-all-together*/}

This playground can help you "get a feel" for how Effects work in practice.

This example uses [`setTimeout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) to schedule a console log with the input text to appear three seconds after the Effect runs. The cleanup function cancels the pending timeout. Start by pressing "Mount the component":

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


You will see three logs at first: `Schedule "a" log`, `Cancel "a" log`, and `Schedule "a" log` again. Three second later there will also be a log saying `a`. As you learned earlier, the extra schedule/cancel pair is because React remounts the component once in development to verify that you've implemented cleanup well.

Now edit the input to say `abc`. If you do it fast enough, you'll see `Schedule "ab" log` immediately followed by `Cancel "ab" log` and `Schedule "abc" log`. **React always cleans up the previous render's Effect before the next render's Effect.** This is why even if you type into the input fast, there is at most one timeout scheduled at a time. Edit the input a few times and watch the console to get a feel for how Effects get cleaned up.

Type something into the input and then immediately press "Unmount the component". Notice how unmounting cleans up the last render's Effect. Here, it clears the last timeout before it has a chance to fire.

Finally, edit the component above and comment out the cleanup function so that the timeouts don't get cancelled. Try typing `abcde` fast. What do you expect to happen in three seconds? Will `console.log(text)` inside the timeout print the *latest* `text` and produce five `abcde` logs? Give it a try to check your intuition!

Three seconds later, you should see a sequence of logs (`a`, `ab`, `abc`, `abcd`, and `abcde`) rather than five `abcde` logs. **Each Effect "captures" the `text` value from its corresponding render.**  It doesn't matter that the `text` state changed: an Effect from the render with `text = 'ab'` will always see `'ab'`. In other words, Effects from each render are isolated from each other. If you're curious how this works, you can read about [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

This [helps you find Effects that need cleanup](#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) and exposes bugs like race conditions early. Additionally, React will remount the Effects whenever you save a file in development. Both of these behaviors are development-only.


- Unlike events, Effects are caused by rendering itself rather than a particular interaction.
- Effects let you synchronize a component with some external system (third-party API, network, etc).
- By default, Effects run after every render (including the initial one).
- React will skip the Effect if all of its dependencies have the same values as during the last render.
- You can't "choose" your dependencies. They are determined by the code inside the Effect.
- Empty dependency array (`[]`) corresponds to the component "mounting", i.e. being added to the screen.
- In Strict Mode, React mounts components twice (in development only!) to stress-test your Effects.
- If your Effect breaks because of remounting, you need to implement a cleanup function.
- React will call your cleanup function before the Effect runs next time, and during the unmount.




# You Might Not Need An Effect

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you "step outside" of React and synchronize your components with some external system like a non-React widget, network, or the browser DOM. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component's state when some props or state change), you shouldn't need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

## How to remove unnecessary Effects {/*how-to-remove-unnecessary-effects*/}

There are two common cases in which you don't need Effects:

* **You don't need Effects to transform data for rendering.** For example, let's say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will ["commit"](/learn/render-and-commit) these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect *also* immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.
* **You don't need Effects to handle user events.** For example, let's say you want to send an `/api/buy` POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product. In the Buy button click event handler, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don't know *what* the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you'll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers.

You *do* need Effects to [synchronize](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events) with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state. You can also fetch data with Effects: for example, you can synchronize the search results with the current search query. Keep in mind that modern [frameworks](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than writing Effects directly in your components.

To help you gain the right intuition, let's look at some common concrete examples!

### Updating state based on props or state {/*updating-state-based-on-props-or-state*/}

Suppose you have a component with two state variables: `firstName` and `lastName`. You want to calculate a `fullName` from them by concatenating them. Moreover, you'd like `fullName` to update whenever `firstName` or `lastName` change. Your first instinct might be to add a `fullName` state variable and update it in an Effect:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [8]}} {5-9}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
  // ...
}
```

This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for `fullName`, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove the state variable and the Effect:

```js {4-5}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  // ...
}
```

**When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, [don't put it in state.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state) Instead, calculate it during rendering.** This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra "cascading" updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other). If this approach feels new to you, [Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react#step-3-find-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state) explains what should go into state.

### Caching expensive calculations {/*caching-expensive-calculations*/}

This component computes `visibleTodos` by taking the `todos` it receives by props and filtering them according to the `filter` prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in state and update it from an Effect:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [7]}} {4-8}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    setVisibleTodos(getFilteredTodos(todos, filter));
  }, [todos, filter]);

  // ...
}
```

Like in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect:

```js {3-4}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  // ✅ This is fine if getFilteredTodos() is not slow.
  const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
  // ...
}
```

Usually, this code is fine! But maybe `getFilteredTodos()` is slow or you have a lot of `todos`. In that case you don't want to recalculate `getFilteredTodos()` if some unrelated state variable like `newTodo` has changed.

You can cache (or ["memoize"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)) an expensive calculation by wrapping it in a [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) Hook:

> **Note:**
>
> 
> 
> [React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler) can automatically memoize expensive calculations for you, eliminating the need for manual `useMemo` in many cases.
> 
> 


```js {5-8}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    // ✅ Does not re-run unless todos or filter change
    return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
  }, [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```

Or, written as a single line:

```js {5-6}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  // ✅ Does not re-run getFilteredTodos() unless todos or filter change
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```

**This tells React that you don't want the inner function to re-run unless either `todos` or `filter` have changed.** React will remember the return value of `getFilteredTodos()` during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if `todos` or `filter` are different. If they're the same as last time, `useMemo` will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the inner function again (and store its result).

The function you wrap in [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) runs during rendering, so this only works for [pure calculations.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

> **Deep Dive: How to tell if a calculation is expensive? {/*how-to-tell-if-a-calculation-is-expensive*/}**
>
> In general, unless you're creating or looping over thousands of objects, it's probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code:
> 
> ```js {1,3}
> console.time('filter array');
> const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
> console.timeEnd('filter array');
> ```
> 
> Perform the interaction you're measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like `filter array: 0.15ms` in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, `1ms` or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in `useMemo` to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not:
> 
> ```js
> console.time('filter array');
> const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
>   return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter); // Skipped if todos and filter haven't changed
> }, [todos, filter]);
> console.timeEnd('filter array');
> ```
> 
> `useMemo` won't make the *first* render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates.
> 
> Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users' so it's a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a [CPU Throttling](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling) option for this.
> 
> Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.


### Resetting all state when a prop changes {/*resetting-all-state-when-a-prop-changes*/}

This `ProfilePage` component receives a `userId` prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a `comment` state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the `comment` state does not get reset. As a result, it's easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user's profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the `comment` state variable whenever the `userId` changes:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [6]}} {4-7}
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setComment('');
  }, [userId]);
  // ...
}
```

This is inefficient because `ProfilePage` and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you'd need to do this in *every* component that has some state inside `ProfilePage`. For example, if the comment UI is nested, you'd want to clear out nested comment state too.

Instead, you can tell React that each user's profile is conceptually a _different_ profile by giving it an explicit key. Split your component in two and pass a `key` attribute from the outer component to the inner one:

```js {5,11-12}
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  return (
    <Profile
      userId={userId}
      key={userId}
    />
  );
}

function Profile({ userId }) {
  // ✅ This and any other state below will reset on key change automatically
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');
  // ...
}
```

Normally, React preserves the state when the same component is rendered in the same spot. **By passing `userId` as a `key` to the `Profile` component, you're asking React to treat two `Profile` components with different `userId` as two different components that should not share any state.** Whenever the key (which you've set to `userId`) changes, React will recreate the DOM and [reset the state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#option-2-resetting-state-with-a-key) of the `Profile` component and all of its children. Now the `comment` field will clear out automatically when navigating between profiles.

Note that in this example, only the outer `ProfilePage` component is exported and visible to other files in the project. Components rendering `ProfilePage` don't need to pass the key to it: they pass `userId` as a regular prop. The fact `ProfilePage` passes it as a `key` to the inner `Profile` component is an implementation detail.

### Adjusting some state when a prop changes {/*adjusting-some-state-when-a-prop-changes*/}

Sometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it.

This `List` component receives a list of `items` as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the `selection` state variable. You want to reset the `selection` to `null` whenever the `items` prop receives a different array:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [7]}} {5-8}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // 🔴 Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setSelection(null);
  }, [items]);
  // ...
}
```

This, too, is not ideal. Every time the `items` change, the `List` and its child components will render with a stale `selection` value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the `setSelection(null)` call will cause another re-render of the `List` and its child components, restarting this whole process again.

Start by deleting the Effect. Instead, adjust the state directly during rendering:

```js {5-11}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // Better: Adjust the state while rendering
  const [prevItems, setPrevItems] = useState(items);
  if (items !== prevItems) {
    setPrevItems(items);
    setSelection(null);
  }
  // ...
}
```

[Storing information from previous renders](/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders) like this can be hard to understand, but it’s better than updating the same state in an Effect. In the above example, `setSelection` is called directly during a render. React will re-render the `List` *immediately* after it exits with a `return` statement. React has not rendered the `List` children or updated the DOM yet, so this lets the `List` children skip rendering the stale `selection` value.

When you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering. To avoid very slow cascading retries, React only lets you update the *same* component's state during a render. If you update another component's state during a render, you'll see an error. A condition like `items !== prevItems` is necessary to avoid loops. You may adjust state like this, but any other side effects (like changing the DOM or setting timeouts) should stay in event handlers or Effects to [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

**Although this pattern is more efficient than an Effect, most components shouldn't need it either.** No matter how you do it, adjusting state based on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can [reset all state with a key](#resetting-all-state-when-a-prop-changes) or [calculate everything during rendering](#updating-state-based-on-props-or-state) instead. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected *item*, you can store the selected *item ID:*

```js {3-5}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);
  // ✅ Best: Calculate everything during rendering
  const selection = items.find(item => item.id === selectedId) ?? null;
  // ...
}
```

Now there is no need to "adjust" the state at all. If the item with the selected ID is in the list, it remains selected. If it's not, the `selection` calculated during rendering will be `null` because no matching item was found. This behavior is different, but arguably better because most changes to `items` preserve the selection.

### Sharing logic between event handlers {/*sharing-logic-between-event-handlers*/}

Let's say you have a product page with two buttons (Buy and Checkout) that both let you buy that product. You want to show a notification whenever the user puts the product in the cart. Calling `showNotification()` in both buttons' click handlers feels repetitive so you might be tempted to place this logic in an Effect:

```js {2-7}
function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {
  // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (product.isInCart) {
      showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);
    }
  }, [product]);

  function handleBuyClick() {
    addToCart(product);
  }

  function handleCheckoutClick() {
    addToCart(product);
    navigateTo('/checkout');
  }
  // ...
}
```

This Effect is unnecessary. It will also most likely cause bugs. For example, let's say that your app "remembers" the shopping cart between the page reloads. If you add a product to the cart once and refresh the page, the notification will appear again. It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product's page. This is because `product.isInCart` will already be `true` on the page load, so the Effect above will call `showNotification()`.

**When you're not sure whether some code should be in an Effect or in an event handler, ask yourself *why* this code needs to run. Use Effects only for code that should run *because* the component was displayed to the user.** In this example, the notification should appear because the user *pressed the button*, not because the page was displayed! Delete the Effect and put the shared logic into a function called from both event handlers:

```js {2-6,9,13}
function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {
  // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers
  function buyProduct() {
    addToCart(product);
    showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);
  }

  function handleBuyClick() {
    buyProduct();
  }

  function handleCheckoutClick() {
    buyProduct();
    navigateTo('/checkout');
  }
  // ...
}
```

This both removes the unnecessary Effect and fixes the bug.

### Sending a POST request {/*sending-a-post-request*/}

This `Form` component sends two kinds of POST requests. It sends an analytics event when it mounts. When you fill in the form and click the Submit button, it will send a POST request to the `/api/register` endpoint:

```js {5-8,10-16}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  // ✅ Good: This logic should run because the component was displayed
  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });
  }, []);

  // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
  const [jsonToSubmit, setJsonToSubmit] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (jsonToSubmit !== null) {
      post('/api/register', jsonToSubmit);
    }
  }, [jsonToSubmit]);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setJsonToSubmit({ firstName, lastName });
  }
  // ...
}
```

Let's apply the same criteria as in the example before.

The analytics POST request should remain in an Effect. This is because the _reason_ to send the analytics event is that the form was displayed. (It would fire twice in development, but [see here](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#sending-analytics) for how to deal with that.)

However, the `/api/register` POST request is not caused by the form being _displayed_. You only want to send the request at one specific moment in time: when the user presses the button. It should only ever happen _on that particular interaction_. Delete the second Effect and move that POST request into the event handler:

```js {12-13}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  // ✅ Good: This logic runs because the component was displayed
  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });
  }, []);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is in the event handler
    post('/api/register', { firstName, lastName });
  }
  // ...
}
```

When you choose whether to put some logic into an event handler or an Effect, the main question you need to answer is _what kind of logic_ it is from the user's perspective. If this logic is caused by a particular interaction, keep it in the event handler. If it's caused by the user _seeing_ the component on the screen, keep it in the Effect.

### Chains of computations {/*chains-of-computations*/}

Sometimes you might feel tempted to chain Effects that each adjust a piece of state based on other state:

```js {7-29}
function Game() {
  const [card, setCard] = useState(null);
  const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0);
  const [round, setRound] = useState(1);
  const [isGameOver, setIsGameOver] = useState(false);

  // 🔴 Avoid: Chains of Effects that adjust the state solely to trigger each other
  useEffect(() => {
    if (card !== null && card.gold) {
      setGoldCardCount(c => c + 1);
    }
  }, [card]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (goldCardCount > 3) {
      setRound(r => r + 1)
      setGoldCardCount(0);
    }
  }, [goldCardCount]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (round > 5) {
      setIsGameOver(true);
    }
  }, [round]);

  useEffect(() => {
    alert('Good game!');
  }, [isGameOver]);

  function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) {
    if (isGameOver) {
      throw Error('Game already ended.');
    } else {
      setCard(nextCard);
    }
  }

  // ...
```

There are two problems with this code.

The first problem is that it is very inefficient: the component (and its children) have to re-render between each `set` call in the chain. In the example above, in the worst case (`setCard` → render → `setGoldCardCount` → render → `setRound` → render → `setIsGameOver` → render) there are three unnecessary re-renders of the tree below.

The second problem is that even if it weren't slow, as your code evolves, you will run into cases where the "chain" you wrote doesn't fit the new requirements. Imagine you are adding a way to step through the history of the game moves. You'd do it by updating each state variable to a value from the past. However, setting the `card` state to a value from the past would trigger the Effect chain again and change the data you're showing. Such code is often rigid and fragile.

In this case, it's better to calculate what you can during rendering, and adjust the state in the event handler:

```js {6-7,14-26}
function Game() {
  const [card, setCard] = useState(null);
  const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0);
  const [round, setRound] = useState(1);

  // ✅ Calculate what you can during rendering
  const isGameOver = round > 5;

  function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) {
    if (isGameOver) {
      throw Error('Game already ended.');
    }

    // ✅ Calculate all the next state in the event handler
    setCard(nextCard);
    if (nextCard.gold) {
      if (goldCardCount < 3) {
        setGoldCardCount(goldCardCount + 1);
      } else {
        setGoldCardCount(0);
        setRound(round + 1);
        if (round === 5) {
          alert('Good game!');
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // ...
```

This is a lot more efficient. Also, if you implement a way to view game history, now you will be able to set each state variable to a move from the past without triggering the Effect chain that adjusts every other value. If you need to reuse logic between several event handlers, you can [extract a function](#sharing-logic-between-event-handlers) and call it from those handlers.

Remember that inside event handlers, [state behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) For example, even after you call `setRound(round + 1)`, the `round` variable will reflect the value at the time the user clicked the button. If you need to use the next value for calculations, define it manually like `const nextRound = round + 1`.

In some cases, you *can't* calculate the next state directly in the event handler. For example, imagine a form with multiple dropdowns where the options of the next dropdown depend on the selected value of the previous dropdown. Then, a chain of Effects is appropriate because you are synchronizing with network.

### Initializing the application {/*initializing-the-application*/}

Some logic should only run once when the app loads.

You might be tempted to place it in an Effect in the top-level component:

```js {2-6}
function App() {
  // 🔴 Avoid: Effects with logic that should only ever run once
  useEffect(() => {
    loadDataFromLocalStorage();
    checkAuthToken();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

However, you'll quickly discover that it [runs twice in development.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development) This can cause issues--for example, maybe it invalidates the authentication token because the function wasn't designed to be called twice. In general, your components should be resilient to being remounted. This includes your top-level `App` component.

Although it may not ever get remounted in practice in production, following the same constraints in all components makes it easier to move and reuse code. If some logic must run *once per app load* rather than *once per component mount*, add a top-level variable to track whether it has already executed:

```js {1,5-6,10}
let didInit = false;

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!didInit) {
      didInit = true;
      // ✅ Only runs once per app load
      loadDataFromLocalStorage();
      checkAuthToken();
    }
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

You can also run it during module initialization and before the app renders:

```js {1,5}
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.
   // ✅ Only runs once per app load
  checkAuthToken();
  loadDataFromLocalStorage();
}

function App() {
  // ...
}
```

Code at the top level runs once when your component is imported--even if it doesn't end up being rendered. To avoid slowdown or surprising behavior when importing arbitrary components, don't overuse this pattern. Keep app-wide initialization logic to root component modules like `App.js` or in your application's entry point.

### Notifying parent components about state changes {/*notifying-parent-components-about-state-changes*/}

Let's say you're writing a `Toggle` component with an internal `isOn` state which can be either `true` or `false`. There are a few different ways to toggle it (by clicking or dragging). You want to notify the parent component whenever the `Toggle` internal state changes, so you expose an `onChange` event and call it from an Effect:

```js {4-7}
function Toggle({ onChange }) {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  // 🔴 Avoid: The onChange handler runs too late
  useEffect(() => {
    onChange(isOn);
  }, [isOn, onChange])

  function handleClick() {
    setIsOn(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      setIsOn(true);
    } else {
      setIsOn(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

Like earlier, this is not ideal. The `Toggle` updates its state first, and React updates the screen. Then React runs the Effect, which calls the `onChange` function passed from a parent component. Now the parent component will update its own state, starting another render pass. It would be better to do everything in a single pass.

Delete the Effect and instead update the state of *both* components within the same event handler:

```js {5-7,11,16,18}
function Toggle({ onChange }) {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  function updateToggle(nextIsOn) {
    // ✅ Good: Perform all updates during the event that caused them
    setIsOn(nextIsOn);
    onChange(nextIsOn);
  }

  function handleClick() {
    updateToggle(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      updateToggle(true);
    } else {
      updateToggle(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

With this approach, both the `Toggle` component and its parent component update their state during the event. React [batches updates](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) from different components together, so there will only be one render pass.

You might also be able to remove the state altogether, and instead receive `isOn` from the parent component:

```js {1,2}
// ✅ Also good: the component is fully controlled by its parent
function Toggle({ isOn, onChange }) {
  function handleClick() {
    onChange(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      onChange(true);
    } else {
      onChange(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

["Lifting state up"](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) lets the parent component fully control the `Toggle` by toggling the parent's own state. This means the parent component will have to contain more logic, but there will be less state overall to worry about. Whenever you try to keep two different state variables synchronized, try lifting state up instead!

### Passing data to the parent {/*passing-data-to-the-parent*/}

This `Child` component fetches some data and then passes it to the `Parent` component in an Effect:

```js {9-14}
function Parent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  // ...
  return <Child onFetched={setData} />;
}

function Child({ onFetched }) {
  const data = useSomeAPI();
  // 🔴 Avoid: Passing data to the parent in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (data) {
      onFetched(data);
    }
  }, [onFetched, data]);
  // ...
}
```

In React, data flows from the parent components to their children. When you see something wrong on the screen, you can trace where the information comes from by going up the component chain until you find which component passes the wrong prop or has the wrong state. When child components update the state of their parent components in Effects, the data flow becomes very difficult to trace. Since both the child and the parent need the same data, let the parent component fetch that data, and *pass it down* to the child instead:

```js {4-5}
function Parent() {
  const data = useSomeAPI();
  // ...
  // ✅ Good: Passing data down to the child
  return <Child data={data} />;
}

function Child({ data }) {
  // ...
}
```

This is simpler and keeps the data flow predictable: the data flows down from the parent to the child.

### Subscribing to an external store {/*subscribing-to-an-external-store*/}

Sometimes, your components may need to subscribe to some data outside of the React state. This data could be from a third-party library or a built-in browser API. Since this data can change without React's knowledge, you need to manually subscribe your components to it. This is often done with an Effect, for example:

```js {2-17}
function useOnlineStatus() {
  // Not ideal: Manual store subscription in an Effect
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function updateState() {
      setIsOnline(navigator.onLine);
    }

    updateState();

    window.addEventListener('online', updateState);
    window.addEventListener('offline', updateState);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', updateState);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', updateState);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}

function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

Here, the component subscribes to an external data store (in this case, the browser `navigator.onLine` API). Since this API does not exist on the server (so it can't be used for the initial HTML), initially the state is set to `true`. Whenever the value of that data store changes in the browser, the component updates its state.

Although it's common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. Delete the Effect and replace it with a call to [`useSyncExternalStore`](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore):

```js {11-16}
function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}

function useOnlineStatus() {
  // ✅ Good: Subscribing to an external store with a built-in Hook
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    subscribe, // React won't resubscribe for as long as you pass the same function
    () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client
    () => true // How to get the value on the server
  );
}

function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

This approach is less error-prone than manually syncing mutable data to React state with an Effect. Typically, you'll write a custom Hook like `useOnlineStatus()` above so that you don't need to repeat this code in the individual components. [Read more about subscribing to external stores from React components.](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)

### Fetching data {/*fetching-data*/}

Many apps use Effects to kick off data fetching. It is quite common to write a data fetching Effect like this:

```js {5-10}
function SearchResults({ query }) {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    // 🔴 Avoid: Fetching without cleanup logic
    fetchResults(query, page).then(json => {
      setResults(json);
    });
  }, [query, page]);

  function handleNextPageClick() {
    setPage(page + 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

You *don't* need to move this fetch to an event handler.

This might seem like a contradiction with the earlier examples where you needed to put the logic into the event handlers! However, consider that it's not *the typing event* that's the main reason to fetch. Search inputs are often prepopulated from the URL, and the user might navigate Back and Forward without touching the input.

It doesn't matter where `page` and `query` come from. While this component is visible, you want to keep `results` [synchronized](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with data from the network for the current `page` and `query`. This is why it's an Effect.

However, the code above has a bug. Imagine you type `"hello"` fast. Then the `query` will change from `"h"`, to `"he"`, `"hel"`, `"hell"`, and `"hello"`. This will kick off separate fetches, but there is no guarantee about which order the responses will arrive in. For example, the `"hell"` response may arrive *after* the `"hello"` response. Since it will call `setResults()` last, you will be displaying the wrong search results. This is called a ["race condition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition): two different requests "raced" against each other and came in a different order than you expected.

**To fix the race condition, you need to [add a cleanup function](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#fetching-data) to ignore stale responses:**

```js {5,7,9,11-13}
function SearchResults({ query }) {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetchResults(query, page).then(json => {
      if (!ignore) {
        setResults(json);
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [query, page]);

  function handleNextPageClick() {
    setPage(page + 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

This ensures that when your Effect fetches data, all responses except the last requested one will be ignored.

Handling race conditions is not the only difficulty with implementing data fetching. You might also want to think about caching responses (so that the user can click Back and see the previous screen instantly), how to fetch data on the server (so that the initial server-rendered HTML contains the fetched content instead of a spinner), and how to avoid network waterfalls (so that a child can fetch data without waiting for every parent).

**These issues apply to any UI library, not just React. Solving them is not trivial, which is why modern [frameworks](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than fetching data in Effects.**

If you don't use a framework (and don't want to build your own) but would like to make data fetching from Effects more ergonomic, consider extracting your fetching logic into a custom Hook like in this example:

```js {4}
function SearchResults({ query }) {
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ query, page });
  const results = useData(`/api/search?${params}`);

  function handleNextPageClick() {
    setPage(page + 1);
  }
  // ...
}

function useData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setData(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [url]);
  return data;
}
```

You'll likely also want to add some logic for error handling and to track whether the content is loading. You can build a Hook like this yourself or use one of the many solutions already available in the React ecosystem. **Although this alone won't be as efficient as using a framework's built-in data fetching mechanism, moving the data fetching logic into a custom Hook will make it easier to adopt an efficient data fetching strategy later.**

In general, whenever you have to resort to writing Effects, keep an eye out for when you can extract a piece of functionality into a custom Hook with a more declarative and purpose-built API like `useData` above. The fewer raw `useEffect` calls you have in your components, the easier you will find to maintain your application.

- If you can calculate something during render, you don't need an Effect.
- To cache expensive calculations, add `useMemo` instead of `useEffect`.
- To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different `key` to it.
- To reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering.
- Code that runs because a component was *displayed* should be in Effects, the rest should be in events.
- If you need to update the state of several components, it's better to do it during a single event.
- Whenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up.
- You can fetch data with Effects, but you need to implement cleanup to avoid race conditions.




# Lifecycle Of Reactive Effects

Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time. React provides a linter rule to check that you've specified your Effect's dependencies correctly. This keeps your Effect synchronized to the latest props and state.

- How an Effect's lifecycle is different from a component's lifecycle
- How to think about each individual Effect in isolation
- When your Effect needs to re-synchronize, and why
- How your Effect's dependencies are determined
- What it means for a value to be reactive
- What an empty dependency array means
- How React verifies your dependencies are correct with a linter
- What to do when you disagree with the linter

## The lifecycle of an Effect {/*the-lifecycle-of-an-effect*/}

Every React component goes through the same lifecycle:

- A component _mounts_ when it's added to the screen.
- A component _updates_ when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.
- A component _unmounts_ when it's removed from the screen.

**It's a good way to think about components, but _not_ about Effects.** Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component's lifecycle. An Effect describes how to [synchronize an external system](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) to the current props and state. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often.

To illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server:

```js
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

Your Effect's body specifies how to **start synchronizing:**

```js {2-3}
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
    // ...
```

The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to **stop synchronizing:**

```js {5}
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
    // ...
```

Intuitively, you might think that React would **start synchronizing** when your component mounts and **stop synchronizing** when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to **start and stop synchronizing multiple times** while the component remains mounted.

Let's look at _why_ this is necessary, _when_ it happens, and _how_ you can control this behavior.

> **Note:**
>
> 
> 
> Some Effects don't return a cleanup function at all. [More often than not,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development) you'll want to return one--but if you don't, React will behave as if you returned an empty cleanup function.
>

### Why synchronization may need to happen more than once {/*why-synchronization-may-need-to-happen-more-than-once*/}

Imagine this `ChatRoom` component receives a `roomId` prop that the user picks in a dropdown. Let's say that initially the user picks the `"general"` room as the `roomId`. Your app displays the `"general"` chat room:

```js {3}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "general" */ }) {
  // ...
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

After the UI is displayed, React will run your Effect to **start synchronizing.** It connects to the `"general"` room:

```js {3,4}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "general" */ }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "general" room
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the "general" room
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
```

So far, so good.

Later, the user picks a different room in the dropdown (for example, `"travel"`). First, React will update the UI:

```js {1}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "travel" */ }) {
  // ...
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

Think about what should happen next. The user sees that `"travel"` is the selected chat room in the UI. However, the Effect that ran the last time is still connected to the `"general"` room. **The `roomId` prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the `"general"` room) no longer matches the UI.**

At this point, you want React to do two things:

1. Stop synchronizing with the old `roomId` (disconnect from the `"general"` room)
2. Start synchronizing with the new `roomId` (connect to the `"travel"` room)

**Luckily, you've already taught React how to do both of these things!** Your Effect's body specifies how to start synchronizing, and your cleanup function specifies how to stop synchronizing. All that React needs to do now is to call them in the correct order and with the correct props and state. Let's see how exactly that happens.

### How React re-synchronizes your Effect {/*how-react-re-synchronizes-your-effect*/}

Recall that your `ChatRoom` component has received a new value for its `roomId` prop. It used to be `"general"`, and now it is `"travel"`. React needs to re-synchronize your Effect to re-connect you to a different room.

To **stop synchronizing,** React will call the cleanup function that your Effect returned after connecting to the `"general"` room. Since `roomId` was `"general"`, the cleanup function disconnects from the `"general"` room:

```js {6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "general" */ }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "general" room
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the "general" room
    };
    // ...
```

Then React will run the Effect that you've provided during this render. This time, `roomId` is `"travel"` so it will **start synchronizing** to the `"travel"` chat room (until its cleanup function is eventually called too):

```js {3,4}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "travel" */ }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "travel" room
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

Thanks to this, you're now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster averted!

Every time after your component re-renders with a different `roomId`, your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, let's say the user changes `roomId` from `"travel"` to `"music"`. React will again **stop synchronizing** your Effect by calling its cleanup function (disconnecting you from the `"travel"` room). Then it will **start synchronizing** again by running its body with the new `roomId` prop (connecting you to the `"music"` room).

Finally, when the user goes to a different screen, `ChatRoom` unmounts. Now there is no need to stay connected at all. React will **stop synchronizing** your Effect one last time and disconnect you from the `"music"` chat room.

### Thinking from the Effect's perspective {/*thinking-from-the-effects-perspective*/}

Let's recap everything that's happened from the `ChatRoom` component's perspective:

1. `ChatRoom` mounted with `roomId` set to `"general"`
1. `ChatRoom` updated with `roomId` set to `"travel"`
1. `ChatRoom` updated with `roomId` set to `"music"`
1. `ChatRoom` unmounted

During each of these points in the component's lifecycle, your Effect did different things:

1. Your Effect connected to the `"general"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"general"` room and connected to the `"travel"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"travel"` room and connected to the `"music"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"music"` room

Now let's think about what happened from the perspective of the Effect itself:

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    // Your Effect connected to the room specified with roomId...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      // ...until it disconnected
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
```

This code's structure might inspire you to see what happened as a sequence of non-overlapping time periods:

1. Your Effect connected to the `"general"` room (until it disconnected)
1. Your Effect connected to the `"travel"` room (until it disconnected)
1. Your Effect connected to the `"music"` room (until it disconnected)

Previously, you were thinking from the component's perspective. When you looked from the component's perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as "callbacks" or "lifecycle events" that fire at a specific time like "after a render" or "before unmount". This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it's best to avoid.

**Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn't matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it's needed.**

This might remind you how you don't think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React [figures out the rest.](/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state)

### How React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize {/*how-react-verifies-that-your-effect-can-re-synchronize*/}

Here is a live example that you can play with. Press "Open chat" to mount the `ChatRoom` component:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Notice that when the component mounts for the first time, you see three logs:

1. `✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...` *(development-only)*
1. `❌ Disconnected from "general" room at https://localhost:1234.` *(development-only)*
1. `✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...`

The first two logs are development-only. In development, React always remounts each component once.

**React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development.** This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check [you've implemented its cleanup well.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

The main reason your Effect will re-synchronize in practice is if some data it uses has changed. In the sandbox above, change the selected chat room. Notice how, when the `roomId` changes, your Effect re-synchronizes.

However, there are also more unusual cases in which re-synchronization is necessary. For example, try editing the `serverUrl` in the sandbox above while the chat is open. Notice how the Effect re-synchronizes in response to your edits to the code. In the future, React may add more features that rely on re-synchronization.

### How React knows that it needs to re-synchronize the Effect {/*how-react-knows-that-it-needs-to-re-synchronize-the-effect*/}

You might be wondering how React knew that your Effect needed to re-synchronize after `roomId` changes. It's because *you told React* that its code depends on `roomId` by including it in the [list of dependencies:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies)

```js {1,3,8}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // The roomId prop may change over time
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads roomId 
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]); // So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" roomId
  // ...
```

Here's how this works:

1. You knew `roomId` is a prop, which means it can change over time.
2. You knew that your Effect reads `roomId` (so its logic depends on a value that may change later).
3. This is why you specified it as your Effect's dependency (so that it re-synchronizes when `roomId` changes).

Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize your Effect.

For example, if you passed `["general"]` during the initial render, and later you passed `["travel"]` during the next render, React will compare `"general"` and `"travel"`. These are different values (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), so React will re-synchronize your Effect. On the other hand, if your component re-renders but `roomId` has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room.

### Each Effect represents a separate synchronization process {/*each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process*/}

Resist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time as an Effect you already wrote. For example, let's say you want to send an analytics event when the user visits the room. You already have an Effect that depends on `roomId`, so you might feel tempted to add the analytics call there:

```js {3}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(roomId);
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

But imagine you later add another dependency to this Effect that needs to re-establish the connection. If this Effect re-synchronizes, it will also call `logVisit(roomId)` for the same room, which you did not intend. Logging the visit **is a separate process** from connecting. Write them as two separate Effects:

```js {2-4}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(roomId);
  }, [roomId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    // ...
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

**Each Effect in your code should represent a separate and independent synchronization process.**

In the above example, deleting one Effect wouldn’t break the other Effect's logic. This is a good indication that they synchronize different things, and so it made sense to split them up. On the other hand, if you split up a cohesive piece of logic into separate Effects, the code may look "cleaner" but will be [more difficult to maintain.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#chains-of-computations) This is why you should think whether the processes are same or separate, not whether the code looks cleaner.

## Effects "react" to reactive values {/*effects-react-to-reactive-values*/}

Your Effect reads two variables (`serverUrl` and `roomId`), but you only specified `roomId` as a dependency:

```js {5,10}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

Why doesn't `serverUrl` need to be a dependency?

This is because the `serverUrl` never changes due to a re-render. It's always the same no matter how many times the component re-renders and why. Since `serverUrl` never changes, it wouldn't make sense to specify it as a dependency. After all, dependencies only do something when they change over time!

On the other hand, `roomId` may be different on a re-render. **Props, state, and other values declared inside the component are _reactive_ because they're calculated during rendering and participate in the React data flow.**

If `serverUrl` was a state variable, it would be reactive. Reactive values must be included in dependencies:

```js {2,5,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // Props change over time
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // State may change over time

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads props and state
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" on props and state
  // ...
}
```

By including `serverUrl` as a dependency, you ensure that the Effect re-synchronizes after it changes.

Try changing the selected chat room or edit the server URL in this sandbox:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Whenever you change a reactive value like `roomId` or `serverUrl`, the Effect re-connects to the chat server.

### What an Effect with empty dependencies means {/*what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means*/}

What happens if you move both `serverUrl` and `roomId` outside the component?

```js {1,2}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'general';

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now your Effect's code does not use *any* reactive values, so its dependencies can be empty (`[]`).

Thinking from the component's perspective, the empty `[]` dependency array means this Effect connects to the chat room only when the component mounts, and disconnects only when the component unmounts. (Keep in mind that React would still [re-synchronize it an extra time](#how-react-verifies-that-your-effect-can-re-synchronize) in development to stress-test your logic.)


[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


However, if you [think from the Effect's perspective,](#thinking-from-the-effects-perspective) you don't need to think about mounting and unmounting at all. What's important is you've specified what your Effect does to start and stop synchronizing. Today, it has no reactive dependencies. But if you ever want the user to change `roomId` or `serverUrl` over time (and they would become reactive), your Effect's code won't change. You will only need to add them to the dependencies.

### All variables declared in the component body are reactive {/*all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive*/}

Props and state aren't the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.

Let's say that the user can pick a chat server in the dropdown, but they can also configure a default server in settings. Suppose you've already put the settings state in a [context](/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) so you read the `settings` from that context. Now you calculate the `serverUrl` based on the selected server from props and the default server:

```js {3,5,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, selectedServerUrl }) { // roomId is reactive
  const settings = useContext(SettingsContext); // settings is reactive
  const serverUrl = selectedServerUrl ?? settings.defaultServerUrl; // serverUrl is reactive
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads roomId and serverUrl
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So it needs to re-synchronize when either of them changes!
  // ...
}
```

In this example, `serverUrl` is not a prop or a state variable. It's a regular variable that you calculate during rendering. But it's calculated during rendering, so it can change due to a re-render. This is why it's reactive.

**All values inside the component (including props, state, and variables in your component's body) are reactive. Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect's dependencies.**

In other words, Effects "react" to all values from the component body.

>
> Mutable values (including global variables) aren't reactive.
> 
> **A mutable value like [`location.pathname`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/pathname) can't be a dependency.** It's mutable, so it can change at any time completely outside of the React rendering data flow. Changing it wouldn't trigger a re-render of your component. Therefore, even if you specified it in the dependencies, React *wouldn't know* to re-synchronize the Effect when it changes. This also breaks the rules of React because reading mutable data during rendering (which is when you calculate the dependencies) breaks [purity of rendering.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) Instead, you should read and subscribe to an external mutable value with [`useSyncExternalStore`.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#subscribing-to-an-external-store)
> 
> **A mutable value like [`ref.current`](/reference/react/useRef#reference) or things you read from it also can't be a dependency.** The ref object returned by `useRef` itself can be a dependency, but its `current` property is intentionally mutable. It lets you [keep track of something without triggering a re-render.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) But since changing it doesn't trigger a re-render, it's not a reactive value, and React won't know to re-run your Effect when it changes.

> As you'll learn below on this page, a linter will check for these issues automatically.


### React verifies that you specified every reactive value as a dependency {/*react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency*/}

If your linter is [configured for React,](/learn/editor-setup#linting) it will check that every reactive value used by your Effect's code is declared as its dependency. For example, this is a lint error because both `roomId` and `serverUrl` are reactive:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


This may look like a React error, but really React is pointing out a bug in your code. Both `roomId` and `serverUrl` may change over time, but you're forgetting to re-synchronize your Effect when they change. You will remain connected to the initial `roomId` and `serverUrl` even after the user picks different values in the UI.

To fix the bug, follow the linter's suggestion to specify `roomId` and `serverUrl` as dependencies of your Effect:

```js {9}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // roomId is reactive
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // serverUrl is reactive
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Try this fix in the sandbox above. Verify that the linter error is gone, and the chat re-connects when needed.

> **Note:**
>
> 
> 
> In some cases, React *knows* that a value never changes even though it's declared inside the component. For example, the [`set` function](/reference/react/useState#setstate) returned from `useState` and the ref object returned by [`useRef`](/reference/react/useRef) are *stable*--they are guaranteed to not change on a re-render. Stable values aren't reactive, so you may omit them from the list. Including them is allowed: they won't change, so it doesn't matter.
> 
> 


### What to do when you don't want to re-synchronize {/*what-to-do-when-you-dont-want-to-re-synchronize*/}

In the previous example, you've fixed the lint error by listing `roomId` and `serverUrl` as dependencies.

**However, you could instead "prove" to the linter that these values aren't reactive values,** i.e. that they *can't* change as a result of a re-render. For example, if `serverUrl` and `roomId` don't depend on rendering and always have the same values, you can move them outside the component. Now they don't need to be dependencies:

```js {1,2,11}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive
const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

You can also move them *inside the Effect.* They aren't calculated during rendering, so they're not reactive:

```js {3,4,10}
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive
    const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

**Effects are reactive blocks of code.** They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary.

**You can't "choose" your dependencies.** Your dependencies must include every [reactive value](#all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive) you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. Sometimes this may lead to problems like infinite loops and to your Effect re-synchronizing too often. Don't fix these problems by suppressing the linter! Here's what to try instead:

* **Check that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process.** If your Effect doesn't synchronize anything, [it might be unnecessary.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) If it synchronizes several independent things, [split it up.](#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process)

* **If you want to read the latest value of props or state without "reacting" to it and re-synchronizing the Effect,** you can split your Effect into a reactive part (which you'll keep in the Effect) and a non-reactive part (which you'll extract into something called an _Effect Event_). [Read about separating Events from Effects.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects)

* **Avoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies.** If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time. [Read more about removing unnecessary dependencies from Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

If the linter suggests a dependency, but adding it causes a loop, it doesn't mean the linter should be ignored. You need to change the code inside (or outside) the Effect so that that value isn't reactive and doesn't *need* to be a dependency.

- Components can mount, update, and unmount.
- Each Effect has a separate lifecycle from the surrounding component.
- Each Effect describes a separate synchronization process that can *start* and *stop*.
- When you write and read Effects, think from each individual Effect's perspective (how to start and stop synchronization) rather than from the component's perspective (how it mounts, updates, or unmounts).
- Values declared inside the component body are "reactive".
- Reactive values should re-synchronize the Effect because they can change over time.
- The linter verifies that all reactive values used inside the Effect are specified as dependencies.
- All errors flagged by the linter are legitimate. There's always a way to fix the code to not break the rules.




# Removing Effect Dependencies

When you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you've included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect's dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. Follow this guide to review and remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.

- How to fix infinite Effect dependency loops
- What to do when you want to remove a dependency
- How to read a value from your Effect without "reacting" to it
- How and why to avoid object and function dependencies
- Why suppressing the dependency linter is dangerous, and what to do instead

## Dependencies should match the code {/*dependencies-should-match-the-code*/}

When you write an Effect, you first specify how to [start and stop](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#the-lifecycle-of-an-effect) whatever you want your Effect to be doing:

```js {5-7}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  	// ...
}
```

Then, if you leave the Effect dependencies empty (`[]`), the linter will suggest the correct dependencies:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


Fill them in according to what the linter says:

```js {6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

[Effects "react" to reactive values.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) Since `roomId` is a reactive value (it can change due to a re-render), the linter verifies that you've specified it as a dependency. If `roomId` receives a different value, React will re-synchronize your Effect. This ensures that the chat stays connected to the selected room and "reacts" to the dropdown:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


### To remove a dependency, prove that it's not a dependency {/*to-remove-a-dependency-prove-that-its-not-a-dependency*/}

Notice that you can't "choose" the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect's code must be declared in your dependency list. The dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:

```js [[2, 3, "roomId"], [2, 5, "roomId"], [2, 8, "roomId"]]
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads that reactive value
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify that reactive value as a dependency of your Effect
  // ...
}
```

[Reactive values](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive) include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since `roomId` is a reactive value, you can't remove it from the dependency list. The linter wouldn't allow it:

```js {8}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'roomId'
  // ...
}
```

And the linter would be right! Since `roomId` may change over time, this would introduce a bug in your code.

**To remove a dependency, "prove" to the linter that it *doesn't need* to be a dependency.** For example, you can move `roomId` out of your component to prove that it's not reactive and won't change on re-renders:

```js {2,9}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now that `roomId` is not a reactive value (and can't change on a re-render), it doesn't need to be a dependency:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


This is why you could now specify an [empty (`[]`) dependency list.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means) Your Effect *really doesn't* depend on any reactive value anymore, so it *really doesn't* need to re-run when any of the component's props or state change.

### To change the dependencies, change the code {/*to-change-the-dependencies-change-the-code*/}

You might have noticed a pattern in your workflow:

1. First, you **change the code** of your Effect or how your reactive values are declared.
2. Then, you follow the linter and adjust the dependencies to **match the code you have changed.**
3. If you're not happy with the list of dependencies, you **go back to the first step** (and change the code again).

The last part is important. **If you want to change the dependencies, change the surrounding code first.** You can think of the dependency list as [a list of all the reactive values used by your Effect's code.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) You don't *choose* what to put on that list. The list *describes* your code. To change the dependency list, change the code.

This might feel like solving an equation. You might start with a goal (for example, to remove a dependency), and you need to "find" the code matching that goal. Not everyone finds solving equations fun, and the same thing could be said about writing Effects! Luckily, there is a list of common recipes that you can try below.

## Removing unnecessary dependencies {/*removing-unnecessary-dependencies*/}

Every time you adjust the Effect's dependencies to reflect the code, look at the dependency list. Does it make sense for the Effect to re-run when any of these dependencies change? Sometimes, the answer is "no":

* You might want to re-execute *different parts* of your Effect under different conditions.
* You might want to only read the *latest value* of some dependency instead of "reacting" to its changes.
* A dependency may change too often *unintentionally* because it's an object or a function.

To find the right solution, you'll need to answer a few questions about your Effect. Let's walk through them.

### Should this code move to an event handler? {/*should-this-code-move-to-an-event-handler*/}

The first thing you should think about is whether this code should be an Effect at all.

Imagine a form. On submit, you set the `submitted` state variable to `true`. You need to send a POST request and show a notification. You've put this logic inside an Effect that "reacts" to `submitted` being `true`:

```js {6-8}
function Form() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (submitted) {
      // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
      post('/api/register');
      showNotification('Successfully registered!');
    }
  }, [submitted]);

  function handleSubmit() {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }

  // ...
}
```

Later, you want to style the notification message according to the current theme, so you read the current theme. Since `theme` is declared in the component body, it is a reactive value, so you add it as a dependency:

```js {3,9,11}
function Form() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (submitted) {
      // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
      post('/api/register');
      showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);
    }
  }, [submitted, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  function handleSubmit() {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }  

  // ...
}
```

By doing this, you've introduced a bug. Imagine you submit the form first and then switch between Dark and Light themes. The `theme` will change, the Effect will re-run, and so it will display the same notification again!

**The problem here is that this shouldn't be an Effect in the first place.** You want to send this POST request and show the notification in response to *submitting the form,* which is a particular interaction. To run some code in response to particular interaction, put that logic directly into the corresponding event handler:

```js {6-7}
function Form() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  function handleSubmit() {
    // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers
    post('/api/register');
    showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);
  }  

  // ...
}
```

Now that the code is in an event handler, it's not reactive--so it will only run when the user submits the form. Read more about [choosing between event handlers and Effects](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reactive-values-and-reactive-logic) and [how to delete unnecessary Effects.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

### Is your Effect doing several unrelated things? {/*is-your-effect-doing-several-unrelated-things*/}

The next question you should ask yourself is whether your Effect is doing several unrelated things.

Imagine you're creating a shipping form where the user needs to choose their city and area. You fetch the list of `cities` from the server according to the selected `country` to show them in a dropdown:

```js
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

This is a good example of [fetching data in an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#fetching-data) You are synchronizing the `cities` state with the network according to the `country` prop. You can't do this in an event handler because you need to fetch as soon as `ShippingForm` is displayed and whenever the `country` changes (no matter which interaction causes it).

Now let's say you're adding a second select box for city areas, which should fetch the `areas` for the currently selected `city`. You might start by adding a second `fetch` call for the list of areas inside the same Effect:

```js {15-24,28}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    // 🔴 Avoid: A single Effect synchronizes two independent processes
    if (city) {
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
    }
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country, city]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

However, since the Effect now uses the `city` state variable, you've had to add `city` to the list of dependencies. That, in turn, introduced a problem: when the user selects a different city, the Effect will re-run and call `fetchCities(country)`. As a result, you will be unnecessarily refetching the list of cities many times.

**The problem with this code is that you're synchronizing two different unrelated things:**

1. You want to synchronize the `cities` state to the network based on the `country` prop.
1. You want to synchronize the `areas` state to the network based on the `city` state.

Split the logic into two Effects, each of which reacts to the prop that it needs to synchronize with:

```js {19-33}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (city) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [city]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

Now the first Effect only re-runs if the `country` changes, while the second Effect re-runs when the `city` changes. You've separated them by purpose: two different things are synchronized by two separate Effects. Two separate Effects have two separate dependency lists, so they won't trigger each other unintentionally.

The final code is longer than the original, but splitting these Effects is still correct. [Each Effect should represent an independent synchronization process.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process) In this example, deleting one Effect doesn't break the other Effect's logic. This means they *synchronize different things,* and it's good to split them up. If you're concerned about duplication, you can improve this code by [extracting repetitive logic into a custom Hook.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#when-to-use-custom-hooks)

### Are you reading some state to calculate the next state? {/*are-you-reading-some-state-to-calculate-the-next-state*/}

This Effect updates the `messages` state variable with a newly created array every time a new message arrives:

```js {2,6-8}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);
    });
    // ...
```

It uses the `messages` variable to [create a new array](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) starting with all the existing messages and adds the new message at the end. However, since `messages` is a reactive value read by an Effect, it must be a dependency:

```js {7,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, messages]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

And making `messages` a dependency introduces a problem.

Every time you receive a message, `setMessages()` causes the component to re-render with a new `messages` array that includes the received message. However, since this Effect now depends on `messages`, this will *also* re-synchronize the Effect. So every new message will make the chat re-connect. The user would not like that!

To fix the issue, don't read `messages` inside the Effect. Instead, pass an [updater function](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) to `setMessages`:

```js {7,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

**Notice how your Effect does not read the `messages` variable at all now.** You only need to pass an updater function like `msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]`. React [puts your updater function in a queue](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) and will provide the `msgs` argument to it during the next render. This is why the Effect itself doesn't need to depend on `messages` anymore. As a result of this fix, receiving a chat message will no longer make the chat re-connect.

### Do you want to read a value without "reacting" to its changes? {/*do-you-want-to-read-a-value-without-reacting-to-its-changes*/}

Suppose that you want to play a sound when the user receives a new message unless `isMuted` is `true`:

```js {3,10-12}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
      if (!isMuted) {
        playSound();
      }
    });
    // ...
```

Since your Effect now uses `isMuted` in its code, you have to add it to the dependencies:

```js {10,15}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
      if (!isMuted) {
        playSound();
      }
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, isMuted]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

The problem is that every time `isMuted` changes (for example, when the user presses the "Muted" toggle), the Effect will re-synchronize, and reconnect to the chat. This is not the desired user experience! (In this example, even disabling the linter would not work--if you do that, `isMuted` would get "stuck" with its old value.)

To solve this problem, you need to extract the logic that shouldn't be reactive out of the Effect. You don't want this Effect to "react" to the changes in `isMuted`. [Move this non-reactive piece of logic into an Effect Event:](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#declaring-an-effect-event)

```js {1,7-12,18,21}
import { useState, useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);

  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(receivedMessage => {
    setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
    if (!isMuted) {
      playSound();
    }
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      onMessage(receivedMessage);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Effect Events let you split an Effect into reactive parts (which should "react" to reactive values like `roomId` and their changes) and non-reactive parts (which only read their latest values, like `onMessage` reads `isMuted`). **Now that you read `isMuted` inside an Effect Event, it doesn't need to be a dependency of your Effect.** As a result, the chat won't re-connect when you toggle the "Muted" setting on and off, solving the original issue!

#### Wrapping an event handler from the props {/*wrapping-an-event-handler-from-the-props*/}

You might run into a similar problem when your component receives an event handler as a prop:

```js {1,8,11}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      onReceiveMessage(receivedMessage);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, onReceiveMessage]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Suppose that the parent component passes a *different* `onReceiveMessage` function on every render:

```js {3-5}
<ChatRoom
  roomId={roomId}
  onReceiveMessage={receivedMessage => {
    // ...
  }}
/>
```

Since `onReceiveMessage` is a dependency, it would cause the Effect to re-synchronize after every parent re-render. This would make it re-connect to the chat. To solve this, wrap the call in an Effect Event:

```js {4-6,12,15}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(receivedMessage => {
    onReceiveMessage(receivedMessage);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      onMessage(receivedMessage);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Effect Events aren't reactive, so you don't need to specify them as dependencies. As a result, the chat will no longer re-connect even if the parent component passes a function that's different on every re-render.

#### Separating reactive and non-reactive code {/*separating-reactive-and-non-reactive-code*/}

In this example, you want to log a visit every time `roomId` changes. You want to include the current `notificationCount` with every log, but you *don't* want a change to `notificationCount` to trigger a log event.

The solution is again to split out the non-reactive code into an Effect Event:

```js {2-4,7}
function Chat({ roomId, notificationCount }) {
  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedRoomId => {
    logVisit(visitedRoomId, notificationCount);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(roomId);
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

You want your logic to be reactive with regards to `roomId`, so you read `roomId` inside of your Effect. However, you don't want a change to `notificationCount` to log an extra visit, so you read `notificationCount` inside of the Effect Event. [Learn more about reading the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events)

### Does some reactive value change unintentionally? {/*does-some-reactive-value-change-unintentionally*/}

Sometimes, you *do* want your Effect to "react" to a certain value, but that value changes more often than you'd like--and might not reflect any actual change from the user's perspective. For example, let's say that you create an `options` object in the body of your component, and then read that object from inside of your Effect:

```js {3-6,9}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  // ...
  const options = {
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

This object is declared in the component body, so it's a [reactive value.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) When you read a reactive value like this inside an Effect, you declare it as a dependency. This ensures your Effect "reacts" to its changes:

```js {3,6}
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

It is important to declare it as a dependency! This ensures, for example, that if the `roomId` changes, your Effect will re-connect to the chat with the new `options`. However, there is also a problem with the code above. To see it, try typing into the input in the sandbox below, and watch what happens in the console:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


In the sandbox above, the input only updates the `message` state variable. From the user's perspective, this should not affect the chat connection. However, every time you update the `message`, your component re-renders. When your component re-renders, the code inside of it runs again from scratch.

A new `options` object is created from scratch on every re-render of the `ChatRoom` component. React sees that the `options` object is a *different object* from the `options` object created during the last render. This is why it re-synchronizes your Effect (which depends on `options`), and the chat re-connects as you type.

**This problem only affects objects and functions. In JavaScript, each newly created object and function is considered distinct from all the others. It doesn't matter that the contents inside of them may be the same!**

```js {7-8}
// During the first render
const options1 = { serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234', roomId: 'music' };

// During the next render
const options2 = { serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234', roomId: 'music' };

// These are two different objects!
console.log(Object.is(options1, options2)); // false
```

**Object and function dependencies can make your Effect re-synchronize more often than you need.** 

This is why, whenever possible, you should try to avoid objects and functions as your Effect's dependencies. Instead, try moving them outside the component, inside the Effect, or extracting primitive values out of them.

#### Move static objects and functions outside your component {/*move-static-objects-and-functions-outside-your-component*/}

If the object does not depend on any props and state, you can move that object outside your component:

```js {1-4,13}
const options = {
  serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
  roomId: 'music'
};

function ChatRoom() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

This way, you *prove* to the linter that it's not reactive. It can't change as a result of a re-render, so it doesn't need to be a dependency. Now re-rendering `ChatRoom` won't cause your Effect to re-synchronize.

This works for functions too:

```js {1-6,12}
function createOptions() {
  return {
    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
    roomId: 'music'
  };
}

function ChatRoom() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Since `createOptions` is declared outside your component, it's not a reactive value. This is why it doesn't need to be specified in your Effect's dependencies, and why it won't ever cause your Effect to re-synchronize.

#### Move dynamic objects and functions inside your Effect {/*move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect*/}

If your object depends on some reactive value that may change as a result of a re-render, like a `roomId` prop, you can't pull it *outside* your component. You can, however, move its creation *inside* of your Effect's code:

```js {7-10,11,14}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Now that `options` is declared inside of your Effect, it is no longer a dependency of your Effect. Instead, the only reactive value used by your Effect is `roomId`. Since `roomId` is not an object or function, you can be sure that it won't be *unintentionally* different. In JavaScript, numbers and strings are compared by their content:

```js {7-8}
// During the first render
const roomId1 = 'music';

// During the next render
const roomId2 = 'music';

// These two strings are the same!
console.log(Object.is(roomId1, roomId2)); // true
```

Thanks to this fix, the chat no longer re-connects if you edit the input:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


However, it *does* re-connect when you change the `roomId` dropdown, as you would expect.

This works for functions, too:

```js {7-12,14}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    function createOptions() {
      return {
        serverUrl: serverUrl,
        roomId: roomId
      };
    }

    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

You can write your own functions to group pieces of logic inside your Effect. As long as you also declare them *inside* your Effect, they're not reactive values, and so they don't need to be dependencies of your Effect.

#### Read primitive values from objects {/*read-primitive-values-from-objects*/}

Sometimes, you may receive an object from props:

```js {1,5,8}
function ChatRoom({ options }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

The risk here is that the parent component will create the object during rendering:

```js {3-6}
<ChatRoom
  roomId={roomId}
  options={{
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  }}
/>
```

This would cause your Effect to re-connect every time the parent component re-renders. To fix this, read information from the object *outside* the Effect, and avoid having object and function dependencies:

```js {4,7-8,12}
function ChatRoom({ options }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const { roomId, serverUrl } = options;
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({
      roomId: roomId,
      serverUrl: serverUrl
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

The logic gets a little repetitive (you read some values from an object outside an Effect, and then create an object with the same values inside the Effect). But it makes it very explicit what information your Effect *actually* depends on. If an object is re-created unintentionally by the parent component, the chat would not re-connect. However, if `options.roomId` or `options.serverUrl` really are different, the chat would re-connect.

#### Calculate primitive values from functions {/*calculate-primitive-values-from-functions*/}

The same approach can work for functions. For example, suppose the parent component passes a function:

```js {3-8}
<ChatRoom
  roomId={roomId}
  getOptions={() => {
    return {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }}
/>
```

To avoid making it a dependency (and causing it to re-connect on re-renders), call it outside the Effect. This gives you the `roomId` and `serverUrl` values that aren't objects, and that you can read from inside your Effect:

```js {1,4}
function ChatRoom({ getOptions }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const { roomId, serverUrl } = getOptions();
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({
      roomId: roomId,
      serverUrl: serverUrl
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

This only works for [pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure) functions because they are safe to call during rendering. If your function is an event handler, but you don't want its changes to re-synchronize your Effect, [wrap it into an Effect Event instead.](#do-you-want-to-read-a-value-without-reacting-to-its-changes)

- Dependencies should always match the code.
- When you're not happy with your dependencies, what you need to edit is the code.
- Suppressing the linter leads to very confusing bugs, and you should always avoid it.
- To remove a dependency, you need to "prove" to the linter that it's not necessary.
- If some code should run in response to a specific interaction, move that code to an event handler.
- If different parts of your Effect should re-run for different reasons, split it into several Effects.
- If you want to update some state based on the previous state, pass an updater function.
- If you want to read the latest value without "reacting" it, extract an Effect Event from your Effect.
- In JavaScript, objects and functions are considered different if they were created at different times.
- Try to avoid object and function dependencies. Move them outside the component or inside the Effect.




# Separating Events From Effects

Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if some value they read, like a prop or a state variable, is different from what it was during the last render. Sometimes, you also want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others. This page will teach you how to do that.

- How to choose between an event handler and an Effect
- Why Effects are reactive, and event handlers are not
- What to do when you want a part of your Effect's code to not be reactive
- What Effect Events are, and how to extract them from your Effects
- How to read the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events

## Choosing between event handlers and Effects {/*choosing-between-event-handlers-and-effects*/}

First, let's recap the difference between event handlers and Effects.

Imagine you're implementing a chat room component. Your requirements look like this:

1. Your component should automatically connect to the selected chat room.
1. When you click the "Send" button, it should send a message to the chat.

Let's say you've already implemented the code for them, but you're not sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every time you need to answer this question, consider [*why* the code needs to run.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events)

### Event handlers run in response to specific interactions {/*event-handlers-run-in-response-to-specific-interactions*/}

From the user's perspective, sending a message should happen *because* the particular "Send" button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let you handle specific interactions:

```js {4-6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  // ...
  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

With an event handler, you can be sure that `sendMessage(message)` will *only* run if the user presses the button.

### Effects run whenever synchronization is needed {/*effects-run-whenever-synchronization-is-needed*/}

Recall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat room. Where does that code go?

The *reason* to run this code is not some particular interaction. It doesn't matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they're looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not performed any interactions at all, you would *still* need to connect. This is why it's an Effect:

```js {3-9}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

With this code, you can be sure that there is always an active connection to the currently selected chat server, *regardless* of the specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another screen and back, your Effect ensures that the component will *remain synchronized* with the currently selected room, and will [re-connect whenever it's necessary.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#why-synchronization-may-need-to-happen-more-than-once)

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


## Reactive values and reactive logic {/*reactive-values-and-reactive-logic*/}

Intuitively, you could say that event handlers are always triggered "manually", for example by clicking a button. Effects, on the other hand, are "automatic": they run and re-run as often as it's needed to stay synchronized.

There is a more precise way to think about this.

Props, state, and variables declared inside your component's body are called reactive values. In this example, `serverUrl` is not a reactive value, but `roomId` and `message` are. They participate in the rendering data flow:

```js [[2, 3, "roomId"], [2, 4, "message"]]
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  // ...
}
```

Reactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example, the user may edit the `message` or choose a different `roomId` in a dropdown. Event handlers and Effects respond to changes differently:

- **Logic inside event handlers is *not reactive.*** It will not run again unless the user performs the same interaction (e.g. a click) again. Event handlers can read reactive values without "reacting" to their changes.
- **Logic inside Effects is *reactive.*** If your Effect reads a reactive value, [you have to specify it as a dependency.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) Then, if a re-render causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect's logic with the new value.

Let's revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference.

### Logic inside event handlers is not reactive {/*logic-inside-event-handlers-is-not-reactive*/}

Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not?

```js [[2, 2, "message"]]
    // ...
    sendMessage(message);
    // ...
```

From the user's perspective, **a change to the `message` does _not_ mean that they want to send a message.** It only means that the user is typing. In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive. It should not run again only because the reactive value has changed. That's why it belongs in the event handler:

```js {2}
  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }
```

Event handlers aren't reactive, so `sendMessage(message)` will only run when the user clicks the Send button.

### Logic inside Effects is reactive {/*logic-inside-effects-is-reactive*/}

Now let's return to these lines:

```js [[2, 2, "roomId"]]
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

From the user's perspective, **a change to the `roomId` *does* mean that they want to connect to a different room.** In other words, the logic for connecting to the room should be reactive. You *want* these lines of code to "keep up" with the reactive value, and to run again if that value is different. That's why it belongs in an Effect:

```js {2-3}
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect()
    };
  }, [roomId]);
```

Effects are reactive, so `createConnection(serverUrl, roomId)` and `connection.connect()` will run for every distinct value of `roomId`. Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently selected room.

## Extracting non-reactive logic out of Effects {/*extracting-non-reactive-logic-out-of-effects*/}

Things get more tricky when you want to mix reactive logic with non-reactive logic.

For example, imagine that you want to show a notification when the user connects to the chat. You read the current theme (dark or light) from the props so that you can show the notification in the correct color:

```js {1,4-6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

However, `theme` is a reactive value (it can change as a result of re-rendering), and [every reactive value read by an Effect must be declared as its dependency.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) Now you have to specify `theme` as a dependency of your Effect:

```js {5,11}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect()
    };
  }, [roomId, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Play with this example and see if you can spot the problem with this user experience:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


When the `roomId` changes, the chat re-connects as you would expect. But since `theme` is also a dependency, the chat *also* re-connects every time you switch between the dark and the light theme. That's not great!

In other words, you *don't* want this line to be reactive, even though it is inside an Effect (which is reactive):

```js
      // ...
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
      // ...
```

You need a way to separate this non-reactive logic from the reactive Effect around it.

### Declaring an Effect Event {/*declaring-an-effect-event*/}

Use a special Hook called [`useEffectEvent`](/reference/react/useEffectEvent) to extract this non-reactive logic out of your Effect:

```js {1,4-6}
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });
  // ...
```

Here, `onConnected` is called an *Effect Event.* It's a part of your Effect logic, but it behaves a lot more like an event handler. The logic inside it is not reactive, and it always "sees" the latest values of your props and state.

Now you can call the `onConnected` Effect Event from inside your Effect:

```js {2-4,9,13}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      onConnected();
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

This solves the problem. Note that you had to *remove* `theme` from the list of your Effect's dependencies, because it's no longer used in the Effect. You also don't need to *add* `onConnected` to it, because **Effect Events are not reactive and must be omitted from dependencies.**

Verify that the new behavior works as you would expect:

[Interactive example removed — see react.dev for live demo]


You can think of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers. The main difference is that event handlers run in response to user interactions, whereas Effect Events are triggered by you from Effects. Effect Events let you "break the chain" between the reactivity of Effects and code that should not be reactive.

### Reading latest props and state with Effect Events {/*reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events*/}

Effect Events let you fix many patterns where you might be tempted to suppress the dependency linter.

For example, say you have an Effect to log the page visits:

```js
function Page() {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

Later, you add multiple routes to your site. Now your `Page` component receives a `url` prop with the current path. You want to pass the `url` as a part of your `logVisit` call, but the dependency linter complains:

```js {1,3}
function Page({ url }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url);
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'url'
  // ...
}
```

Think about what you want the code to do. You *want* to log a separate visit for different URLs since each URL represents a different page. In other words, this `logVisit` call *should* be reactive with respect to the `url`. This is why, in this case, it makes sense to follow the dependency linter, and add `url` as a dependency:

```js {4}
function Page({ url }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now let's say you want to include the number of items in the shopping cart together with every page visit:

```js {2-3,6}
function Page({ url }) {
  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);
  const numberOfItems = items.length;

  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url, numberOfItems);
  }, [url]); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'numberOfItems'
  // ...
}
```

You used `numberOfItems` inside the Effect, so the linter asks you to add it as a dependency. However, you *don't* want the `logVisit` call to be reactive with respect to `numberOfItems`. If the user puts something into the shopping cart, and the `numberOfItems` changes, this *does not mean* that the user visited the page again. In other words, *visiting the page* is, in some sense, an "event". It happens at a precise moment in time.

Split the code in two parts:

```js {5-7,10}
function Page({ url }) {
  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);
  const numberOfItems = items.length;

  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Here, `onVisit` is an Effect Event. The code inside it isn't reactive. This is why you can use `numberOfItems` (or any other reactive value!) without worrying that it will cause the surrounding code to re-execute on changes.

On the other hand, the Effect itself remains reactive. Code inside the Effect uses the `url` prop, so the Effect will re-run after every re-render with a different `url`. This, in turn, will call the `onVisit` Effect Event.

As a result, you will call `logVisit` for every change to the `url`, and always read the latest `numberOfItems`. However, if `numberOfItems` changes on its own, this will not cause any of the code to re-run.

> 
> This would work, but it's better to pass this `url` to the Effect Event explicitly. **By passing `url` as an argument to your Effect Event, you are saying that visiting a page with a different `url` constitutes a separate "event" from the user's perspective.** The `visitedUrl` is a *part* of the "event" that happened:

> ```
> 
> Since your Effect Event explicitly "asks" for the `visitedUrl`, now you can't accidentally remove `url` from the Effect's dependencies. If you remove the `url` dependency (causing distinct page visits to be counted as one), the linter will warn you about it. You want `onVisit` to be reactive with regards to the `url`, so instead of reading the `url` inside (where it wouldn't be reactive), you pass it *from* your Effect.

>     }, 5000); // Delay logging visits

> ```
> 
> Here, `url` inside `onVisit` corresponds to the *latest* `url` (which could have already changed), but `visitedUrl` corresponds to the `url` that originally caused this Effect (and this `onVisit` call) to run.

> The first downside of suppressing the rule is that React will no longer warn you when your Effect needs to "react" to a new reactive dependency you've introduced to your code. In the earlier example, you added `url` to the dependencies *because* React reminded you to do it. You will no longer get such reminders for any future edits to that Effect if you disable the linter. This leads to bugs.

> Here is an example of a confusing bug caused by suppressing the linter. In this example, the `handleMove` function is supposed to read the current `canMove` state variable value in order to decide whether the dot should follow the cursor. However, `canMove` is always `true` inside `handleMove`.

> The problem with this code is in suppressing the dependency linter. If you remove the suppression, you'll see that this Effect should depend on the `handleMove` function. This makes sense: `handleMove` is declared inside the component body, which makes it a reactive value. Every reactive value must be specified as a dependency, or it can potentially get stale over time!
> 
> The author of the original code has "lied" to React by saying that the Effect does not depend (`[]`) on any reactive values. This is why React did not re-synchronize the Effect after `canMove` has changed (and `handleMove` with it). Because React did not re-synchronize the Effect, the `handleMove` attached as a listener is the `handleMove` function created during the initial render. During the initial render, `canMove` was `true`, which is why `handleMove` from the initial render will forever see that value.

### Limitations of Effect Events {/*limitations-of-effect-events*/}

Effect Events are very limited in how you can use them:

* **Only call them from inside Effects.**
* **Never pass them to other components or Hooks.**

For example, don't declare and pass an Effect Event like this:

```js {4-6,8}
function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  });

  useTimer(onTick, 1000); // 🔴 Avoid: Passing Effect Events

  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}

function useTimer(callback, delay) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      callback();
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [delay, callback]); // Need to specify "callback" in dependencies
}
```

Instead, always declare Effect Events directly next to the Effects that use them:

```js {10-12,16,21}
function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useTimer(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, 1000);
  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}

function useTimer(callback, delay) {
  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    callback();
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      onTick(); // ✅ Good: Only called locally inside an Effect
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [delay]); // No need to specify "onTick" (an Effect Event) as a dependency
}
```

Effect Events are non-reactive "pieces" of your Effect code. They should be next to the Effect using them.

- Event handlers run in response to specific interactions.
- Effects run whenever synchronization is needed.
- Logic inside event handlers is not reactive.
- Logic inside Effects is reactive.
- You can move non-reactive logic from Effects into Effect Events.
- Only call Effect Events from inside Effects.
- Don't pass Effect Events to other components or Hooks.
